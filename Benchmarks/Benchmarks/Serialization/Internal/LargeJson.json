When you acquire a thorough comprehension of client’s needs, mistakes and misunderstandings are eliminated. The service provider can proceed with servicing the client, knowing that he/she and the client have a mutual understanding of the desired results. Good communication with a client is one of the most effective tools to building a clientele. It promotes a trusted and relaxed atmosphere for a skeptical or unsure client. A client who is pleased with the service rendered and who feels comfortable and secure with the spa staff will promote the spa through word-of-the-mouth much more readily than a client who is serviced well, but in a brash and hurried manner.",

You can develop more effective communication skills by practicing the techniques of maintaining eye contact, listening, leading, giving feedback, and proper questioning. MAINTAINING EYE CONTACT: The most important part of effective communication is maintaining eye contact. Look into the other person’s eyes while speaking or listening... It shows that you are interested and paying attention. LISTENING: To avoid misunderstandings, give the other person a chance to put their point across without interruptions. People tend to stop communicating when they don’t have a chance to finish thoughts they originally wanted to share with you. LEADING: Make comments and ask questions that encourage the other person to continue communicating in the direction you want. GIVE FEEDBACK: Help the other person understand your position throughout the conversation by responding to statements made. Feedback enables the other person to clarify any misunderstandings and encourages him/her to continue communicating.",

        "Detail": "American International Group, Inc. is a global Company, and wherever we operate, and across every part of our business, we strive to create an inclusive environment which embraces difference and fosters inclusion. We believe that valuing diversity and inclusiveness is a competitive differentiator enabling us to achieve our vision to create unmatched value for our customers, colleagues, business partners and shareholders. This Diversity and Inclusion Policy applies to all AIG employees and consultants, agents, representatives, contractors and contract workers when they act on behalf of AIG. It is intended to complement local statutory provisions. AIG embraces and supports our employees’ differences in age, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, language differences, nationality or national origin, family or marital status, physical, mental and development abilities, race, religion or belief, sexual orientation, skin color, social or economic class, education, work and behavioral styles, political affiliation, military service, caste, and other characteristics that make our employees unique. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion aligns with our values of People and Respect, and is reflected in our global Code of Conduct. Diversity and Inclusion are sponsored at the highest levels in the Company and initiatives are applicable—but not limited—to our practices and policies on global mobility, recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; promotions; transfers; social and recreational programs; layoffs; terminations; and the ongoing development of a work environment built on the premise of equity that ensures: • diversity is recognized as a business interest, with every level of the organization holding responsibility; • communication is respectful between all employees regardless of title  or level; • insights of diverse groups are sought and welcomed; employees are not alienated or excluded because they don’t fit into a set of cultural norms; • an environment where employees feel that their background and lifestyle do not affect perceptions of them as a professional, or affect their opportunities for development and promotion; • flexible working practices are available where appropriate, as there is an appreciation that not everyone can and will work the same hours or in the same way. This removes disadvantage and discrimination to participation in work; • the diversity of our workforce is visible at every level of the organization and in every business area; and • employees are aware of their own unconscious and conscious bias and know how to ensure this does not manifest itself at work. In respecting and valuing the diversity among our employees, and all those with whom we do business, managers and employees are expected to ensure that there is a work environment free of all forms of discrimination and harassment.

Currently, the groups for which an ERG has been established include the following constituencies: • Women • Hispanics/Latinos • Black or African descent • Asian and Pacific Islander • People with Disabilities • Military Veterans • Working Families • Multiple Generations • Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender",

AIG provides a market-competitive, performance-driven Total Direct Compensation (TDC) structure that is applied to employees from every level of the organization, including senior executives, working towards the same AIG-wide goals. TDC consists of an employee’s base salary and annual incentives that reward employees for their individual performance as well as AIG’s business performance. For designated employees, typically grades 24+, TDC also includes long-term incentives. To ensure fair, compelling, competitive and consistent compensation opportunities throughout AIG, with few exceptions, each non-sales job is assigned a grade based on the position’s responsibilities (internal equity) and compensation is administered under a structure that is anchored on competitive market data (external equity).

        "Detail": "To ensure a productive work environment, solicitation between you and your co-workers is generally prohibited during work time. Distribution of nonbusiness related materials in working areas is prohibited at all times. Further, non-AIG employees are not permitted to solicit or distribute literature on AIG premises at any time for any purpose unless the solicitation/distribution relates to products or services offered by AIG’s business partners and is approved by AIG management. You are not permitted to use AIG resources, such as e-mail, bulletin boards, supplies, equipment, or facilities for solicitation or distribution. Small-scale employee collections or sale of items for the benefit of non-profit organizations, such as schools, scouts and other youth clubs, or certain persons in need of charitable assistance, such as local families or employees in distress, are permitted provided that you: • receive advance approval from your manager; • raise funds to serve primarily charitable (vs. social) purposes and events; • do so within your own work area during non-working time and before or after the department’s work hours; • do not pressure other employees to participate; • do not use corporate resources (including e-mail and printers); and • do not interrupt other employees during their work time. You may not sell items to generate a profit for any other purpose, such as running a business. Unapproved solicitation materials may be removed from Company property without notice and may be cause for Corrective Action. For questions about a specific solicitation, you should contact your manager or an HR Shared Services ER Advisor at 1-800-265-5054. NOTE: The Solicitation and Distribution standard does not apply to Company-sponsored volunteerism or charitable events. Likewise, individual solicitations of a charitable (e.g., cookie sales or raffles) or personal (e.g., car for sale) nature may be permitted, provided they are not excessive or do not otherwise interfere with work. Solicitations for the commercial sale of non-AIG products or services (e.g., cosmetics or landscaping services), gambling activities or on behalf of an outside organization are prohibited.

If you are convicted of or charged with a crime, however, a negative public image of the Company and/or the impression of unethical practices within the Company may result. While AIG wishes to protect itself against activities that might be detrimental to its positive image, we also comply with laws that regulate the treatment of employees with certain convictions. For that reason, you are required to report certain charges and all convictions occurring during your employment, under the following guidelines. Charges of criminal behavior or criminal convictions offenses, including those outside the course and scope of your employment with AIG, must be immediately reported to HR Shared Services ER  at 1-800-265-5054. You need not disclose a conviction that is sealed, pardoned, dismissed or expunged or was issued or adjudicated by a youthful offender court. You need not disclose a speeding ticket or other similar traffic offenses. Your failure to immediately report a conviction or charge pursuant to this policy may result in corrective action up to and including termination. The fact that you have reported a conviction or charge will not, by itself, result in your discharge or other disciplinary action. Instead, upon receipt of your report, AIG will determine whether such action is warranted by considering if the charge or conviction will, in any way: • require action by AIG under relevant state and federal laws; • impair your ability to fulfill all responsibilities and perform to the  required standard; • impact the Company’s reputation; or • damage the relationship of trust between you and AIG, or the Company’s clients or other stakeholders.",

It is the responsibility of the employee who has been granted the accommodation to ensure that the service animals relieve themselves outside and the employee is responsible for cleaning up after his or her animal. Employees should not call upon co-workers or facilities staff to assist with caring for their service animals. Working animals are permitted under the direction of Corporate Security. Employees are reminded not to touch, feed or pet a service or working animal when the animal is working as it distracts the animal from the task at hand.

        "Detail": "The Company may employ relatives (see definition below) of current employees, as long as it does not create an actual or perceived conflict of interest. Generally, relatives may work in the same business unit or location given the following guidelines: • no direct reporting relationship may exist between relatives; • no indirect reporting relationship may exist where relatives have influence over one another’s conditions of employment, such as compensation, promotion, transfer, job assignment, performance assessment and/or termination; and • there must not be any potential problem related to security, confidentiality, conflicts of interest or morale created by the hiring of a relative or cohabitant or transfer into a position. The term “relative” includes spouse, domestic partners, parents, children, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, in-laws (brother, sister, mother, father, son, daughter) aunts, uncles, cousins, step-relatives as well as any person sharing the same household. If a relationship does exist as defined above, the Company will make every effort to transfer one of the employees, at their choice, into any suitable vacancy. If there is no agreement between the employees as to who will seek a transfer, the Company will exercise its right to make the choice. If a transfer cannot be effectuated within thirty (30) days the employment relationship of one of them could be terminated. NOTE: Exceptions can only be made by AIG’s Board of Directors and the Senior Vice President of Global Human Resources.

Such relationships give rise to an actual conflict of interest. The senior person in the relationship is referred to as the “Manager” and the junior person in the relationship is referred to as the “Subordinate,” and the “same zone of influence” means that the Manager is in a position to affect the terms and conditions of the Subordinate’s employment. Further, “Manager” does not necessarily refer to your direct manager. Co-workers are not prohibited from engaging in an intimate relationship, provided that neither co-worker involved occupies a position where a reporting relationship or zone of influence exists. However, AIG reserves the right to take appropriate action if the personal relationship of such co-workers gives rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest or if it negatively impacts the work environment.",

To maintain this commitment there will be occasions when we may need to address performance or inappropriate conduct or behavioral issues with our employees. Pursuant to this policy the business may take Corrective Action when performance issues or inappropriate conduct are identified to resolve them in a manner that gets an employee back on track. Corrective Action may include counseling, verbal warning or written warning. If your manager issues a Corrective Action warning you may be presented with a written document. Any of the Corrective Action avenues are intended to identify what the issues are and what may happen if you do not improve your performance or conduct. Performance issues include anything related to your work performance that your manager deems an issue including but not limited to failing to satisfactorily perform your job duties. Inappropriate conduct includes any conduct that is considered a violation of Company policy, practice or code of conduct and may be subject to Corrective Action. Examples of inappropriate conduct include but are not limited to excessive absenteeism, dress code violations and inappropriate use of Company property, along with not adhering to other expectations outlined in the AIG Code of Conduct. Failure to improve your performance or conduct and meet the expectations identified in the Corrective Action may result in the termination of your employment. In addition, there may be performance or inappropriate conduct issues that warrant immediate termination. Further, compliance violations may be disciplined pursuant to the Company discipline procedure for compliance violations. Note, your employment with the Company remains on an “at-will” basis and can be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without notice. Management must consult with an HR Shared Services ER Advisor at 1-800-265-5054 prior to either placing an employee on a warning or terminating an employee absent extraordinary circumstances.

Employees must be meeting the performance expectations of their current role to participate in the VTO program. Employees not performing at a quality level, determined at the sole discretion of their manager will be deemed “not eligible to participate” until performance meets the level set by their manager. The benefits of this program are not available for interns, temporary agency employees, contractors, vendors, or retirees. VTO may be used on projects and with organizations that benefit the community at large. Organizations are generally eligible if they are a charitable 501 (c)(3) organization. Employees can select a charity of their choice or volunteer with other AIG employees as a team at a qualifying, not-for-profit organization. Eligible volunteer activities include: • general organizational assistance; • administrative work; • pro bono work; • manual labor; • participation on a board or committee; • fundraising events; • mentoring, tutoring, coaching, chaperoning; • social service support; or • community building.

        "Detail": "Lactation Rooms provide a private, comfortable place where breastfeeding mothers can express breast milk during the workday. In some business locations a Lactation Room will be designated on a continuous basis while other locations will designate a private space on an as needed basis. Every business and/or office location will evaluate their available space and determine whether a “Lactation Room” may be designated on a continuous basis. If designated, the Lactation Room will be private, sanitary, ventilated, locked, with comfortable seating and an electrical outlet. The room may also include a refrigerator. If no refrigerator is available in the room, you can either bring your own cooler or store expressed breast milk in a shared refrigerator (e.g. refrigerator in break room). The room will be available on a first come, first serve basis. If the room is not available you should consult with HR Shared Services and/or Facilities to locate an additional space for lactation purposes. If there is currently no designated room at your particular business and/or office location, HR Shared Services and/or Facilities will provide you with a private space until such time that a designated Lactation Room is available. If you have a personal, unshared office space that has adequate privacy, you can use your office in place of the designated Lactation Room. Restrooms are not considered an appropriate space for a Lactation Room.",

To that end we provide Paid Time Off (PTO), which enables you to take time for yourself and your family when you need it. PTO gives you the flexibility and the responsibility to manage your time off in a way that makes sense for you and the Company. Our PTO program gives you an allotment of days that encompasses vacation, sick and personal days. You are in control of how you use those days. You will have the flexibility to manage your time outside of the office, ensuring those absences that are unscheduled are not excessive. PTO can be used for, among other things: • vacation; • personal illness or illness of a family member; • doctor visits or sick days; • personal business; • periods of Family and Medical Emergency Leave which are unpaid; • the elimination period of Parental Leave; and • the elimination period for Short Term Disability. In addition, employees who work in a state with a statewide or local Paid Sick Leave law can use up to ten (10) days of accrued PTO per calendar year as PTO – Paid Sick Leave. PTO – Paid Sick Leave days are governed under the guidelines covered in the Paid Sick Leave (PSL) section below.",

If you work any time during a month, you will accrue that month’s PTO entitlement. PTO accruals are based upon your years of service and in certain instances, as noted in the schedules below, your grade level. A year of service for PTO purposes is defined as any calendar year in which you worked. When you are eligible to advance to a greater PTO bank based on years of service, the increase will occur January 1 of each calendar year in which you worked. If you are promoted to a grade level with a greater PTO bank, your entitlement will be increased to that amount as the following month.

If you are full-time and your regular work schedule is less than five days per week, your PTO accrual calculation is prorated and assumes a regular work schedule of 40 hours per week over a five day work week. You do not accrue PTO while on an unpaid leave of absence. With management approval, you may be able to take PTO days prior to accrual. For Example: Maria is eligible for 24 PTO days and her regular schedule is 35 hours per week over a 5 day work week. Maria’s annual PTO pay and accrual is 168 hours  (24 days  x 7 hours each day = 168 hours of PTO).   Kyle is eligible for 24 PTO days and his regular work schedule is 40 hours per week over a 5 day work week. Kyle’s annual PTO pay and accrual is 192 hours  (24 days  x 8 hours each day = 192 hours of PTO).  Brenda is also eligible for 24 PTO days and her regular schedule is 40 hours per week over a 4 day compressed work week. Brenda would also receive an annual PTO pay and accrual of 192 hours (24 days x 8 pro-rated hours each day = 192 hours of PTO).

These are not additional PTO days; rather the ten (10) PTO-Paid Sick Leave days are included in your total PTO bank.

Any PTO days, including those that may be designated as PTO-Paid Sick Leave days, that have been accrued and unused are able to be carried-over up to a maximum of ten (10) days or the carry-over amount per individual state guidelines. Any carry-over PTO days may be used immediately in the new year as PTO-Paid Sick Leave.

        "Detail": "If you work in a state or local jurisdiction with a Paid Sick Leave law, AIG provides Paid Sick Leave time based on the city or county requirements of your work location. The Paid Sick Leave time is front-loaded at the beginning of each calendar year. Using Paid Sick Leave means that this time will not be treated as an occurrence or used as a part of a Corrective Action under applicable AIG attendance policies.  When you use Paid Sick Leave time, you will be paid based on your Annual Base Benefits Rate (ABBR). If you do not use your full allotment of Paid Sick Leave by the end of the calendar year, you will lose it. Paid Sick Leave does not carry over from one calendar year into the next. Similarly, if you leave the Company as a result of termination, resignation, retirement, or death, any unused Paid Sick Leave time will be forfeited and will not be paid out to you. NOTE: Please refer to the Paid Sick Leave matrix (for employees not eligible for PTO) in the Appendix section of this handbook for the jurisdictions and the applicable amount of Paid Sick Leave time.",

Immediate Family Member: For purposes of FML, “Immediate Family Member” is defined as an employee’s parent (not a parent-in-law), spouse, domestic partner or child. Please refer to the Domestic Partner Leave section for additional information. Spouse: For purposes of FML, “Spouse” is defined as an individual who is in a marriage, including common-law marriage, which is legal according to the law of the state where the marriage was entered into, regardless of where the couple resides. “Spouse” also includes individuals who entered into opposite-sex, same-sex, or common-law marriage outside of the United States, as long as the marriage is valid in that other country, and could have been lawfully entered into in at least one state in the United States. Child: For purposes of FML, a “Child” must be under the age of eighteen (18), or eighteen (18) years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability. A child can be a biological, adopted, step or foster child of the employee, a legal ward of the employee, or a child  for whom the employee is  serving in loco-parentis (i.e., the employee has day-to-day responsibilities to care for or financially support the child, but  the employee has no biological or legal relationship with the child, such as in the case of the child of the employee’s domestic partner).

Use of both “continuous” and “intermittent” FML leave is subject to approval by the AIG Benefits Service Center based on review of medical certification from a health care provider, or other supporting documentation such as proof of birth or adoption. Employees seeking FML should provide written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed leave to their manager and the AIG Benefits Service Center. Where advance notice is not possible, such as in the event of a medical emergency, notice should be given as soon as possible. Employees should notify their manager and the AIG Benefits Service Center on each day of absence pending leave approval, unless other arrangements have been made. Pending review of the medical certification (if required), the AIG Benefits Service Center will notify the employee and the employee’s manager that the Company is provisionally designating the leave as FML. Both the employee and the manager will receive periodic written updates as approval or denial determinations are made, and/or FML eligibility is exhausted. Employees on intermittent FML should make a reasonable effort to avoid disrupting Company operations, including scheduling doctor’s appointments outside of work hours. Each incident of intermittent leave must be reported to the employee’s manager, and to the AIG Benefits Service Center. Failure to provide notification of a need for a FML leave or report intermittent leave incidents, and/or failure to provide required medical certification may delay or postpone the commencement of the leave and/or result in Corrective Action.",

In addition, employees will be required to report on their intent to return to work.

Please refer to the FMLA policy for all terms and conditions. FMLA leave banks will not be reduced when an employee takes a domestic partner leave.

You should check the Appendix in this handbook and the AIG Benefits Service Center at 1-800-265-5054 to determine if your state has specific requirements.",

Group Life Insurance: Basic and Supplemental Life Insurance coverage is extended for a maximum of six (6) months following the month in which the uniformed service leave begins. Personal Accident Insurance (Accidental Death and Dismemberment): This coverage is extended for a maximum of six (6) months following the month in which the uniformed service leave begins.

Contributions and matching contributions will stop once the employee goes on unpaid leave status. A returning service member who is eligible for reinstatement has up to three times the period of service – up to five (5) years – to make up missed employee contributions. Please contact the AIG Benefits Service Center at 1-800-265-5054 for more details. Pension Plan: On reemployment, the employee is treated as not having a break in service with the Company for purposes of participation, vesting and accrual of benefits, by reason of the period of absence from employment due to or necessitated by service in the uniformed services. Long Term Disability (LTD): While on unpaid leave status, LTD coverage is extended for a period of one month following the month in which, the unpaid leave began. The employee has the option to re-enroll in benefits immediately upon return from service, without any additional requirements.

In cases in which business needs mandate the immediate filling of the position, the Company will provide the employee with at least one (1) week’s notice so that he orshe has the opportunity to terminate his or her Unpaid Personal Leave and return to work. If the employee cannot return by the time the one (1) week notice period expires, the Company may fill the employee’s  position after the end of the one (1) week notice period. If the employee is unable to return to work by the time the one (1) week notice period expires, and the employee’s position is filled, upon the end of the unpaid personal leave, the employee will be given forty-five (45) unpaid days to look for another position within the Company. If another position is not offered to the employee, the employee will be eligible for severance pursuant to the Company’s severance policy. The forty-five (45) day transition period and severance is not available to an employee who does not return to work after an initial approved Unpaid Personal Leave ends, and the employee has been denied an extension of the originally approved leave period. American International Group, Inc. reserves the right to amend or terminate this Unpaid Personal Leave Policy at any time or from time to time, in its sole discretion.

Many jurisdictions, including most states within the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, China and Brazil have enacted laws protecting the trade secrets of companies and individuals conducting business within their borders. Additionally, the misuse of trade secrets may subject individuals and corporations to civil lawsuits seeking monetary and injunctive relief. Trade secret violations could also irreparably damage the reputation of AIG in the business community and hamper its ability to successfully compete. Questions regarding the trade secret law of a given country should be referred to the attorney covering that country for that profit center. NOTE: AIG is firmly committed to complying with all laws governing trade secrets. Questions about AIG’s trade secret policy should be directed to the General Counsel’s Office at 1-212-770-5427.

        "Detail": "On occasion, outside activities can create the appearance of a potential conflict of interest. AIG respects the privacy of all its employees, but you must disclose outside activities that could result in real or perceived overlaps and/or conflicts between your personal interests and the interests of AIG. The following activities may be considered conflicts and should be reported to your designated compliance officer and your manager, as set forth below, to ensure that any potential conflicts are addressed and resolved as soon as possible: • Service with an outside business or trade association, whether as an employee, board member, officer, trustee, partner or consultant, and especially any business that currently does or seeks to do business with AIG, or competes or seeks to compete with AIG; prior written approval from your manager is required before engaging in this type of outside activity and each request must be submitted to your designated compliance officer as part of the approval process. Managerial and Compliance approval must be renewed on an annual basis, and at any point there is a change in relevant facts upon which the original approval was granted. • Service with a foundation, charity or non-profit organization where you will be paid for your service, or where you hold a position of financial responsibility (e.g., serve as Treasurer, a member of the Audit Committee or a member of the Investment Committee); prior written approval from your manager is required before engaging in this type of outside activity and each request must be submitted to your designated compliance officer as part of the approval process. Managerial and Compliance approval must be renewed on an annual basis, and at any point there is a change in relevant facts upon which the original approval was granted. This provision does not apply to service on the board of a co-op, condominium association or similar entity in which you reside, or a holding Company, trust or similar entity that is established solely for you or your family’s estate or tax planning. • Service with a foundation, charity or non-profit organization that has a business relationship with AIG. No approval for this type of outside activity is required so long as you will not be paid and there is no appearance of a potential or actual conflict of interest. If you have a question whether there is such a conflict, discuss it with your designated compliance officer. (<>)Welcome to AIG (<>)Table of Contents (<>)Working Together (<>)Work-Life Balance (<>)Your Career Leaving the Company (<>)Our Facilities Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Media (<>)Your Benefits (<>)Appendix • A presentation, talk, or service on a panel in which you are offered an honorarium. If you are to be compensated for this type of activity, you must notify your designated compliance officer in writing in advance of any fees that may be received and you may be required to turn the fees received over to AIG. In addition, any materials to be used during the presentation, talk or panel may need to be reviewed before the presentation in accordance with business unit or AIG policy. • Serving as a public official, as an appointee of a governmental entity or running for elected office; prior written approval must be obtained from AIG’s Chief Compliance Officer or his/her designee as well as your manager. Approval must be renewed whenever the term expires and before reelection or reappointment is sought. NOTE: To avoid even the appearance of any conflict with AIG’s interests, whenever you participate in community support efforts outside of AIG-sponsored programs you should never imply AIG endorsement of the effort. Questions about AIG’s participating in outside activities should be directed to your designated Compliance Officer.",

Since there are potentially serious reputational, legal, and monetary consequences and penalties for incorrectly reported information, without proper permission, employees, agents, and representatives of AIG and its businesses are not permitted to make statements to, or answer inquiries from, the media.

Moreover, AIG External Communications and Media Relations must be consulted before any public outreach is undertaken at the business level that could potentially affect the broader AIG platform and/or the AIG brand or the brands of its subsidiaries.

To become an Authorized Communicator, you must complete the Social Media Authorization Form for Authorized Communicators, and be approved as an Authorized Communicator.

However, in recognition that AIG may have multiple business objectives in individual countries, benefit programs may be tailored to employees of specific business entities when indicated by prevailing market practice or appropriate to meet such business objectives.",

Examples of accommodations include, but are not limited to: workplace modifications, leave time, specialized equipment, or reassignment to a vacant position for which you are qualified. You may request an accommodation at any time. We may request medical information to certify that you have a covered disability. In the event that it is necessary to do so, the information will be evaluated by AIG Benefits Service Center at 1-800-265-5054 or the HR Shared Services ER Advisor Team at 1-800-265-5054.

        "Title": "Short Term Disability",
        "Detail": "STD pays a percentage of an employee’s base salary if the employee should become disabled for a short period of time. Disabled employees may be eligible to receive STD for a period of up to twenty-six (26) weeks (or 182 days), which includes a one (1) week elimination period, within a rolling fifty-two (52) week period. Parental Leave is not counted toward the twenty-six (26) weeks. State mandated disability benefit requirements will apply as required by state law. When an employee is absent on STD leave and the twenty-six (26) weeks of leave expire, there will be no further STD benefit. To be eligible for a new STD benefit, the employee must have reached the eligibility date for a new fifty-two (52) rolling-week period. The eligibility date is determined by looking at the first day of the new leave and looking back in time for a fifty-two (52) rolling-week period. Any STD leave used in the preceding fifty-two (52) week period is not available for the new disability and counts toward the new rolling fifty-two (52) week period. Example: An employee who is absent on an STD leave of absence from March 1, 2010 to May 30, 2010 (or 92 days), returns to work, and then incurs a new disability starting on October 1, 2010. Because employees are limited to 182 days of STD leave during a fifty-two (52) rolling-week period, the employee will be eligible for STD leave from October 1, 2010 through December 29, 2010 (or 90 days) for a total of 182 days.",

A “Period of Disability” means a continuous length of time during which the employee is disabled under this policy. If you return to active employment for thirty (30) days or more, any subsequent recurrence of a disability is treated as a new disability. A new disability is subject to a new elimination period and a new maximum duration of STD benefits. The new maximum duration of benefits will be determined using the first day of the new leave and looking back in time over a fifty-two (52) week period. Any STD leave used in the preceding fifty-two (52) week period is not available for the new disability and counts toward the new rolling fifty-two (52) week period.",

        "Detail": "Depending on where the employee works, the employee may be eligible for other types of leave. NOTE: Some states have enacted leave legislation that may supersede this policy. You should check the Appendix in this handbook and the AIG Benefits Service Center at 1-800-265-5054 to determine if your state has specific requirements. STD benefits are reduced by the amount paid or payable for benefits under any state non-occupational benefit law or other compulsory governmental program. For example, the STD benefit will be reduced by any temporary or permanent disability benefit for the loss of income under a state workers’ compensation, occupational disease, or similar law. The maximum benefit amount payable to an employee in a state that has legislation that supersedes this policy will be reduced by the amounts of other payments received for the employee’s disability from the appropriate state. These benefit reductions are commonly known as “offsets.” The AIG Benefits Service Center is not responsible for processing state claims and therefore cannot advise an employee as to when a decision will be made on a state claim, and cannot advise an employee as to the dollar amount of any state benefit/offset.",

        "Detail": "When the workers’ compensation administrator determines an employee is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits, the administrator will pay the employee a non-taxed state mandated income disability benefit. In addition, depending on Company policy, AIG will pay the employee a salary continuation supplement to bring the total amount the employee receives to 100% of his or her regular salary. Employees are entitled to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of combined STD/WC leave in a rolling-back twelve (12) month period. The amount of combined time (STD/WC) the employee has available directly affects the amount of time an employee will be paid a salary continuation supplement in addition to workers’ compensation income disability benefit payments. When the combined bank of STD/WC leave time (up to twenty-six [26] weeks) has been exhausted employees will no longer be eligible for a salary continuation supplement payment from AIG. However, if the employee is still eligible for workers’ compensation benefits, the workers’ compensation administrator will continue to pay income disability benefits directly to employee. (<>)Welcome to AIG (<>)Table of Contents (<>)Working Together (<>)Work-Life Balance (<>)Your Career Leaving the Company (<>)Our Facilities Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Media (<>)Your Benefits (<>)Appendix Example: If an employee goes out on an eight (8) week STD Leave for a non-work related injury in May and then goes back out on leave for a work related injury in November of that same year, the employee will only be eligible for eighteen (18) weeks of a salary continuation supplement. AIG Financial Network and Mount Mansfield employees are not eligible and will not receive a salary continuation supplement from AIG based upon Company specific policies. Instead workers’ compensation income disability payments will become the primary benefit, and paid directly from the workers’ compensation administrator.",

Your manager will coordinate your luncheon or dinner to be held within three (3) months of your service milestone. If you are on an approved leave at the time of its occurrence, your manager will schedule the luncheon or dinner to take place within three (3) months of the date you return from leave. Managers should coordinate with their employees to determine attendees and location. You are welcome to invite family members or a significant other to your celebration. As is practical, managers will be present at the luncheon or dinner in order to acknowledge the milestone being celebrated. In instances where an employee works primarily on a virtual basis and significant travel may unreasonably delay or hinder the celebration, managers may allow an employee to proceed with a celebratory lunch or dinner with family members or significant other and co–workers and submit the expense up to the amount specified below. Please refer to the Service Milestone Celebration Schedule below for guidance on the appropriate cost for the luncheon or dinner. The cost of the meal will be limited to the schedule of expense listed below. Meals planned without the manager’s approval will not be reimbursed by the Company.",

For purposes of this policy, discrimination on the basis of “national origin” also includes discrimination against an individual because that person holds or presents the California driver’s license issued to those who cannot document their lawful presence in the United States.

        "Detail": "Sexual harassment includes unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: • Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of employment; or • Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or • Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Sexual harassment also includes various forms of offensive behavior based on sex and includes gender-based harassment of a person of the same sex as the harasser. The following is a partial list: • Unwanted sexual advances. • Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors. • Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances. • Visual conduct, such as leering, making sexual gestures, displaying sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons, posters, websites, emails or text messages. • Verbal conduct, including making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs, sexually explicit jokes, or comments about an employee’s body  or dress. • Verbal sexual advances or propositions. • Verbal abuse of a sexual nature; graphic verbal commentary about an individual’s body; sexually degrading words to describe an individual; suggestive or obscene letters, notes or invitations. • Physical conduct including touching, assault, impeding or blocking movements. • Retaliation for reporting harassment or threatening to report  sexual harassment. An employee may be liable for harassment based on sex even if the alleged harassing conduct was not motivated by sexual desire. An employee who engages in unlawful harassment may be personally liable for harassment even if the company had no knowledge of such conduct.",

        "Detail": "Any employee or other person covered by this policy who believes that he or she has been harassed, discriminated against, or subjected to retaliation by a co-worker, supervisor, agent, client, vendor, customer, or any other third party workplace contact in violation of the foregoing policies, or who is aware of such behavior against others, should immediately provide a written or verbal report to • AIG Employee Relations at 1-800-265-5054 or email to (<mailto:HRSharedServices@aig.com>)HRSharedServices@aig.com; • AIG Compliance Help Line at 1-877-244-2210 or via Internet at  (<http://www.aigcompliancehelpline.com>)www.aigcompliancehelpline.com; • AIG’s Global Compliance Group at 1-646-857-1877 or email to (<mailto:corporatelegalcompliance@aig.com>)corporatelegalcompliance@aig.com; or • His or her supervisor. Employees are not required to make a complaint directly to their immediate supervisor. Supervisors and managers who receive complaints of misconduct must immediately report such complaints to AIG Employee Relations 1-800-265-5054; they will attempt to resolve issues internally.  When a report is received, the company will conduct a fair, timely, thorough and objective investigation that provides all parties appropriate due process and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected. The company expects all persons to fully cooperate with any investigation conducted by the company into a complaint of proscribed harassment, discrimination or retaliation, or regarding the alleged violation of any other company policies. The company will maintain confidentiality surrounding the investigation to the extent possible and to the extent permitted under applicable federal and state law. Upon completion of the investigation, the company will communicate its conclusion as soon as practical. If the company determines that this policy has been violated, remedial/corrective action will be taken, commensurate with the severity of the offense, up to and including termination of employment. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) will accept and investigate charges of unlawful discrimination or harassment at no charge to the complaining party.

        "Title": "Illinois",
        "Detail": "Sexual harassment is illegal. Under Illinois law sexual harassment is defined as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when (a) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment, (b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Examples of prohibited sexual harassment are contained in the Sexual Harassment portion of the Working Together Section found earlier in this Handbook. Employees who believe that they have been sexually harassed may also file a complaint with the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Illinois Human Rights Commission. The IDHR protects persons from discrimination in all terms and conditions of employment, including hiring, selection, promotion, transfer, pay, tenure, discharge, and discipline. Complaints may be mediated; however, if mediation is either not available or successful, the complaint will move to the investigation stage and the fact-finding conference. Remedies may include back pay, lost benefits, clearing of personnel file, emotional damages, hiring, promotion, reinstatement, front pay where reinstatement is not possible, and attorney’s fees and costs. The Company’s internal complaint procedure is found in the section titled “Reporting a Potential Violation of Law, the AIG Code of Conduct or Other AIG Policy” found earlier in this handbook. Every manager, supervisor and employee must remember that seemingly “harmless” and subtle actions may lead to sexual harassment complaints. The use of terms such as “honey”, “darling” and “sweetheart” is objectionable to many women who believe that these terms undermine their authority and their ability to deal with men on an equal and professional level. And while use of these terms by an individual with authority over a female employee will rarely constitute an adverse employment action, it may lead to the creation of a hostile work environment. Another example is the use of a compliment that could potentially be interpreted as sexual in nature. Below are three statements that might be made about the appearance of a woman in the workplace: • “That’s an attractive dress you have on.” • “That’s an attractive dress. It really looks good on you.” • “That’s an attractive dress. You really fill it out well.” The first statement appears to be simply a compliment. The last is the most likely to be perceived as sexual harassment, depending on individual perceptions and values. To avoid the possibility of offending an employee, it is best to follow a course of conduct above reproach or to err on the side of caution. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct, which affects both genders. Sexual harassment will often involve a man’s conduct directed at a woman. However, it can also involve a woman harassing a man or harassment between members of the same gender.

In addition to the Open Door Complaint Procedure policy found in this handbook, an employee in Illinois may file a formal complaint with either or both of the government agencies set forth below.",

This leave may be up to 12 workweeks in a 12-month period for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of your child or for your own serious health condition or that of your child, parent or spouse. • Even if you are not eligible for CFRA leave, if disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, you are entitled to take pregnancy disability leave (PDL) of up to four months, or the working days in one-third of a year or 171/3 weeks, depending on your period(s) of actual disability. Time off needed for prenatal or postnatal care; doctor-ordered bed rest; gestational diabetes; pregnancy-induced hypertension; preeclampsia; childbirth; postpartum depression; loss or end of pregnancy; or recovery from childbirth or loss or end of pregnancy would all be covered by your PDL.

For events that are unforeseeable, you must to notify your employer, at least verbally, as soon as you learn of the need for the leave. • Failure to comply with these notice rules is grounds for, and may result in, deferral of the requested leave until you comply with this notice policy. • Your employer may require medical certification from your health care provider before allowing you a leave for: ■ your pregnancy; ■ your own serious health condition; or ■ to care for your child, parent, or spouse who has a serious  health condition. • See your employer for a copy of a medical certification form to give to your health care provider to complete. • When medically necessary, leave may be taken on an intermittent or a reduced work schedule. If you are taking a leave for the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child, the basic minimum duration of the leave is two weeks and you must conclude the leave within one year of the birth or placement for adoption or foster care. • Taking a family care or pregnancy disability leave may impact certain of your benefits and your seniority date.

To be eligible, the employee must have worked at least 1,000 hours during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Further, the employee must have worked for an employer in the State that employs 25 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the then-current or immediately preceding calendar year. Leave under the NJ SAFE Act may be taken by an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, as that term is defined in N.J.S.A. 2C:25-19, or a victim of a sexually violent offense, as that term is defined in N.J.S.A. 30:4-27.6. Leave may also be taken by an employee whose child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner is a victim of domestic violence or a sexually violent offense. Leave under the NJ SAFE Act may be taken for the purpose of engaging in any of the following activities as they relate to an incident of domestic violence or a sexually violent offense: • seeking medical attention for, or recovering from, physical or psychological injuries caused by domestic or sexual violence to the employee or the employee’s child, parent, spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner; • obtaining services from a victim services organization for the employee or the employee’s child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner; (<>)Welcome to AIG (<>)Table of Contents (<>)Working Together (<>)Work-Life Balance (<>)Your Career Leaving the Company (<>)Our Facilities Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Media (<>)Your Benefits (<>)Appendix • obtaining psychological or other counseling for the employee or the employee’s child, parent, spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner; • participating in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocating, or taking other actions to increase the safety from future domestic violence or sexual violence or to ensure the economic security of the employee or the employee’s child, parent, spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner; • seeking legal assistance or remedies to ensure the health and safety of the employee or the employee’s child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner, including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceeding related to or derived from domestic violence or sexual violence; or • attending, participating in or preparing for a criminal or civil court proceeding relating to an incident of domestic or sexual violence of which the employee or the employee’s child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner, was a victim. Leave under the NJ SAFE Act must be used in the 12-month period immediately following an instance of domestic violence or a sexually violent offense. The unpaid leave may be taken intermittently in intervals of no less than one day. The unpaid leave shall run concurrently with any paid vacation leave, personal leave, or medical or sick leave that the employee elects to use or which the employer requires the employee to use during any part of the 20-day period of unpaid leave.

        "Title": "LIMITATIONS ON ACCRUAL AND CARRYOVER",
        "Detail": "The PTO that an employee may accrue at any time is limited to the amount of his/her annual calendar year allowance plus ten (10) days. An employee in California can carryover accrued, unused time, but will cease accruing PTO days until the balance falls below the cap, which is the annual accrual plus ten (10) days. If the amount carried over is equal to the employee’s annual allowance plus ten (10) days, there will be no additional accrual of PTO time in the new calendar year until some of the accrued time has been used. Thus, the employee does not earn or accrue PTO for any month in the calendar year where the amount of carryover from the prior year and the amount accrued to-date in the current year equals his or her annual allowance plus ten (10) days. If the PTO is less than the employee’s annual allowance plus ten (10) days, accrual will occur for any month in which the employee’s current PTO balance is less than the employee’s annual allowance plus ten (10) days up to the cap. In no case will an employee’s balance be allowed to exceed the amount of his/her annual allowance plus ten (10) days. EXAMPLE: Marlene earns 2 PTO days per month (24 per calendar year). On December 31, 2012 she had 12 unused PTO days which she carried over into 2013. Marlene did not take PTO between January and November and she accrued an additional 22 days during that time (2 days per month). As of November, she had reached her maximum allowed amount of 34 days (22 days for the current year plus 12 days carryover).  Therefore, she will not accrue any additional PTO until she uses some of her PTO. Assuming she doesn’t take any PTO during the rest of the year, she will carryover 34 days. However, she will not accrue any PTO in 2014 until her balance falls below her maximum allowance (or cap) of 34 days (24 days annual allotment plus 10 carryover days).

        "Title": "NO HARASSMENT POLICY",
        "Detail": "Lowe Automotive Group has always been committed to providing a workplace that is free of discrimination of any kind.  In keeping with this commitment, we will not tolerate harassment of any employee by any person, including any manager, supervisor, co-worker, customer, client, vendor, or any other third party. Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based upon a persons protected status, such as sex, color, race, religion, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, or any other protected status.  The Company will not tolerate harassing conduct that affects tangible job benefits, that interferes unreasonably with a persons work performance, or that creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.  Prohibited harassment includes, for example, jokes about another persons protected status, kidding, teasing or practical jokes directed at a person based on his/her protected status. Sexual harassment deserves special mention. Sexual harassment is conduct based on sex, whether directed toward a person of the opposite or same sex, and may include explicit sexual propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, sexually oriented kidding or teasing, practical jokes, jokes about obscene printed or visual material, and physical contact such as patting, pinching, or brushing against another persons body. Lowe Automotive Group expressly prohibits sexual harassment or sexual misconduct of any kind.  Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other physical, verbal, or visual conduct based on sex, constitutes sexual harassment if: 1. Submission to the conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment. 2. Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision. 3. The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individuals work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. All employees of Lowe Automotive Group are responsible to help ensure that a workplace free of harassment is maintained.  An employee who believes that he or she has experienced or witnessed any type of harassment is asked to immediately notify their immediate supervisor or Manager. Lowe Automotive Groups policy prohibits retaliation against anyone for reporting harassment, assisting in making a harassment complaint, or cooperating in a harassment investigation.  An employee, who believes that they have been retaliated against, is asked to immediately notify their immediate supervisor or Manager.  It is our policy to investigate, immediately and thoroughly, all complaints of harassment and to the fullest extent practicable, and to keep complaints and the terms of resolution confidential, within the necessary bounds of the fact finding process. If an investigation confirms that a violation of this policy has occurred, appropriate corrective action will be taken, including disciplinary actions, up to and including immediate termination of employment.",

Paid Time off is provided in lieu of vacation, sick or personal days.  The intent of Personal Time Off is to provide paid time off for the purposes of intermittent vacation, sick, personal appointments or infrequent days away.  No personal time off is considered earned or as having accrued until the employees anniversary start date of employment.  After completion of one year of full-time employment, full-time employees are entitled to 9 days of personal time off. After 1 year anniversary date, employee earns 2 days for each quarter remaining in the year. <table><tr><td>Jan-Mar \r</td><td>Apr-June \r</td><td>July-Sept \r</td><td>Oct-Dec \r</td></tr><tr><td>  8 days \r</td><td>  6 days \r</td><td>  4 days \r</td><td>  2 days \r</td></tr><tr><td>Example:  \r</td><td>Hired May 2012-Eligible for 6 days May 2013  Hired Nov 2012-Eligible for 2 days Nov 2013 \r</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table> Second year of vacation becomes eligible on January 1st of the following year for 9 days of personal time off for full-time employees.  The following year the employee is eligible for 14 days of personal time off.  After five years of full-time employment with the company you will receive an additional day of personal time off for a total of 15 days of personal time off.  Upon completion of ten years of full-time employment with the company you receive an additional day of personal time off for a total of 16 days of personal time off. Any part-time employee wanting time off without pay must give sufficient notice and consult with the General Manager.  Full-time employees should submit their request for personal time off by February 15th .  Weeks will be selected by seniority and single days can also be selected with the approval of the General Manager. If conflicts do arise and more than one employee wants the same day off, it is up to the General Manager to determine if this can be worked out.  Please give the General Manager enough notice as far in advance as possible so that arrangements can be made to cover any situation that may arise.  Each employee must take the full allotted personal time off days within the calendar year that it is earned.  Unused personal time off days can only be carried over into the next year provided it has the approval of the General Manager, maximum of 5 days.  Upon termination of employment, earned but unused personal time off will be paid except when termination is due to misconduct or due to resignation without notice of at least two weeks. Personal Time Off is granted on an annual basis and the employee is responsible for taking time off in a reasonable manner.  Employees are expected to take time periodically throughout the year as opposed to using most/all days at the beginning or end of a year.  Time off without pay will be granted on a case by case basis.  A PTO time will be allotted in 4 hour or 8 hour increments only",

During an unpaid leave of absence, employees do not accrue Company benefits including vacation pay, sick pay, paid time off (PTO) or any other benefit.  The employee will not lose any seniority by taking an approved unpaid leave of absence.  The employee will be responsible for paying premiums on his or her insurance coverage and that of his or her dependents.

        "Detail": "***Even if you are on FMLA, you must still make arrangements to pay your Health Insurance monthly contribution (You will need to provide a check to the company since you will not be receiving a paycheck) The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Eligible employees are entitled to: Twelve workweeks of leave in a 12-month period for:  the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth;  the placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child within one year of placement;  to care for the employees spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;  a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job;  any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employees spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on covered active duty; or  Twenty-six workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the service members spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave). Lowe Automotive Group administers FMLA on a rolling calendar year basis.  Meaning your eligibility is based on your last occurrence of FMLA. Eligible employees must have been employed for at least 1 year and worked at least 1,250 hours in the preceding year. Requests for FMLA must be filed at least 30 days in advance when leave is foreseen or as soon as possible in case of emergency.  In instances of serious health condition, the company may request a medical certification outlining the condition, length of absence, and estimated return.  Failure to provide this information will result in delay and/or forfeiture of rights under this policy.  This means the absence may then be counted against your record for purposes of discipline for attendance, etc.  We may also require periodic reports during your FMLA leave for status updates and intent to return to work. Employees will be required to use available PTO in conjunction with an approved leave of absence.  Use of PTO will not extend the length of leave. Upon return from Family or Medical Leave, you will be returned to the position you held immediately prior to the leave if the position is vacant.  Certain exceptions exist for Key Employees as defined by law.  If the position is not vacant, you will be placed in an equivalent employment position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.  If you exhaust all leave under this policy and are still unable to return to work, your situation will be reviewed to determine what rights and protections might exist under other Company policies, state and or federal law.",

        "Detail": "Rules and regulations are needed at Lowe Automotive Group, to help provide orderliness, productivity, safety, and a healthy working environment.  The best working conditions exist when these rules are followed.  If any employee disregards or ignores stated policies or rules, or acts in any unbecoming manner, it will be necessary to take disciplinary action.  This action can take any of the following forms: 1. VERBAL WARNING:  A verbal warning will be given to an employee to not continue the present conduct.  This warning may be done on an informal basis or on a formal basis with the General Manager. 2. WRITTEN WARNING:  A written warning may be issued to the employee with a probationary period attached to it.  A probationary period will indicate a time by which the employee has to rectify his/her conduct.  If such conduct is not improved, suspension or dismissal will occur. 3. SUSPENSION:  The suspension may be from 1 to 3 days according to the gravity of the situation.  A written record concerning the suspension will be put in the employees file and the suspension will be without pay. 4.

        "Detail": "Lowe Automotive Group and affiliates recognizes that employees are our most valuable asset and that they are the most important contributors to our continued growth and success. Thus, we are firmly committed to employee safety and will do everything possible to prevent workplace accidents. Crashes attributed to driver distraction are quickly on the rise, in large part because of widespread use of cell phone and other portable electronic devices behind the wheel. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distraction-related fatalities represented 16 percent of all traffic fatalities in 2009. Researchers across the country have found that response times and attentiveness while using a mobile device are as low as those of drunk drivers. In fact, because of the dramatically increased risk of injury and death that comes with texting while driving, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has stated that companies legal obligation to create and maintain a safe and healthful workplace includes having a clear, unequivocal and enforced policy against the hazard of texting while driving. To protect employees driving on company business as well as others on the road, Lowe Automotive Group and affiliates developed this Cell Phone/Electronic Device Use Policy, effective June 1, 2012.",

To make our Code work, managers must be responsible for promptly addressing ethical questions or concerns raised by employees and for taking the appropriate steps to deal with such issues.

We will neither give nor accept business courtesies that constitute, or could reasonably be perceived as constituting, unfair business inducements that would violate law, regulation or polices of Stack Fitness or customers, or would cause embarrassment or reflect negatively on Stack Fitness’s reputation.",

        "Detail": "Most business courtesies offered to us in the course of our employment are offered because of our positions at Stack Fitness. We should not feel any entitlement to accept and keep a business courtesy. Although we may not use our position at Stack Fitness to obtain business courtesies, and we must never ask for them, we may accept unsolicited business courtesies that promote successful working relationships and good will with the firms that Stack Fitness maintains or may establish a business relationship with. Employees who award contracts or who can influence the allocation of business, who create specifications that result in the placement of business or who participate in negotiation of contracts must be particularly careful to avoid actions that create the appearance of favoritism or that may adversely affect the company’s reputation for impartiality and fair dealing. The prudent course is to refuse a courtesy from a supplier when Stack Fitness is involved in choosing or reconfirming a supplier or under circumstances that would create an impression that offering courtesies is the way to obtain Stack Fitness business.",

Further, management may approve other courtesies, including meals, refreshments or entertainment of reasonable value, provided that: The practice does not violate any law or regulation or the standards of conduct of the recipient’s organization. The business courtesy is consistent with industry practice, is infrequent in nature and is not lavish. The business courtesy is properly reflected on the books and records of Stack Fitness.",

        "Title": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST",
        "Detail": "Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. Employees are expected to act fairly and honestly in all transactions within Stack Fitness and with others and to maintain high ethical standards. This policy establishes basic guidelines. To avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest, employees must seek further clarification from the Human Resources Department when necessary. DEFINITION An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee, an established personal acquaintance or a relative as a result of Stack Fitness’s business activity. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage, and as further defined in the “Hiring Relatives” section within the Coworker Relations Policy. Personal gain can result in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which Stack Fitness does business, and/or when an employee or relative receives any commission, kickback, bribe, substantial gift or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business activity with Stack Fitness. No employee should disclose or use confidential information of Stack Fitness for any personal profit or advantage to the employee or any other party. This policy outlines the basic standards of business conduct as well as personal conduct: Honesty, fairness, trustworthiness Avoidance of conflicts between personal interests and the interests of Stack Fitness, or even the appearance of such conflicts Maintenance of Stack Fitness’s reputation striving to create a safe workplace Through leadership at all levels, sustaining a culture where ethical conduct is recognized, respected, and promoted by all employees. Personal judgment should be used to avoid any activity or association that conflicts with the independent exercise of judgment in Stack Fitness’s best interests. Employees are prohibited from offering or accepting cash and extraordinary business courtesies. In general, this would include a courtesy gift (a) intended to corrupt or influence the judgment of the recipient as to secure unfair preferential treatment, or (b) that if publicly disclosed would be embarrassing to Stack Fitness or the other party. If there are any questions as to whether the gift meets one of the criteria listed above, please consult the Human Resources Department. It is Stack Fitness’s policy to conduct its business affairs fairly and impartially in an ethical and proper manner. Integral to this policy is the avoidance of any appearance that employee decisions are influenced by business courtesies offered by those who are affected by an employee's decisions, nor should the acceptance of business courtesies create the appearance that those business decisions are being influenced. No \"presumption of guilt\" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if an employee has any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts or leases, it is imperative that the employee discloses such to an executive of Stack Fitness as soon as possible. The employee also must disclose the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties. Claims of ignorance, good intentions and bad advice are not acceptable excuses for noncompliance. Managers have the additional responsibility to verify that employees who they supervise understand and comply with these business conduct standards. No employee or member of such employee's immediate family should be employed by, serve as a director of, have a financial interest in, or have a business relationship with any outside concern if the employee or family member: Has authority to purchase goods or services for Stack Fitness Might be in a position to influence such purchases Might be in the position to compromise the interest of Stack Fitness Violations of this policy will be taken seriously. If a situation arises that presents a potential violation of this policy, promptly contact a member of the executive team. Discovery of events of questionable, fraudulent or illegal nature, whether accidental or deliberate, or that appear to be in violation of this policy, must be reported to a member of the executive team; knowingly failing to report a violation is a violation of this policy. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Solicitation by employees in working areas is prohibited during their working time or the working time of the employee being solicited. In order to prevent disruption of the operation of our corporate office or studios, the following rules apply to solicitation and the distribution of literature on Stack Fitness property where those activities are not sponsored by Stack Fitness: Solicitation and distribution of literature by non-associates is prohibited. Solicitation and distribution of literature by employees is prohibited in working areas during working times. Solicitation by employees on Stack Fitness property is prohibited when the person soliciting, or the person being solicited is on working time. Working time is the time associates are expected to be working and does not include rest periods, meal periods or other authorized breaks. The sale of non-Stack Fitness commercial products on Stack Fitness property by employees is prohibited at all times. Postings must be approved in advance by Human Resources. Employees are not to remove material from the bulletin boards. Any questions regarding conflict of interest should be directed to the immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department.",

For example: “I am not an authorized spokesperson for the company. You may call Stack Fitness’s corporate headquarters at 954-530-6903. I'm sure that someone in our Marketing Department can help you.” Professional taping at company facilities is also prohibited without the permission of the Chief Brand Officer or a member of the executive team.

Each employee should use all reasonable care to protect or otherwise prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such information. In no event should employees disclose or reveal confidential information within or outside the Company without proper authorization or purpose. \"Confidential information\" refers to a piece of information, or a compilation of information, in any form (on paper, in an electronic file, or otherwise), related to the Company's business that the Company has not made public or authorized to be made public, and that is not generally known to the public through proper means. By way of example, confidential or proprietary information includes, but is not limited to, non-public information regarding the Company's franchisees, business methods and plans, databases, systems, technology, intellectual property, know-how, marketing plans, business development, products, services, research and development, inventions, financial statements, financial projections, financing methods, pricing strategies, customer sources, employee health/medical records, system designs, customer lists and methods of competing.

        "Detail": "Within any group, differences of opinion may sometimes occur, and problems may develop as a result. Stack Fitness’s Open Door policy is intended to provide a means to address any unresolved questions, problems or complaints of associates through honest and direct communication. You may voice a problem and seek relief or a particular result without fear of negative repercussions. You will be treated with courtesy, and, to the extent possible, your concerns will be handled confidentially. At any time during the problem-solving process, employees should feel free to contact the Human Resources Department; however, the following are the recommended steps to have your concerns addressed: You and your immediate manager should discuss your concerns. If the issue involves your immediate manager and you prefer to speak with someone else, you should meet with the next level of manager within your department. The manager will listen and investigate the issue with the intention of finding an agreeable solution in a timely manner. This process should eliminate any misunderstanding and resolve the majority of issues. If the issue is not handled to your satisfaction, you should contact the next level of manager. Together, you will discuss your concerns and seek a solution. Contact the Human Resources Department if the above steps have not resolved your questions or concerns. A member of the Human Resources Department will discuss the issues with you, review the facts thoroughly and provide a response as quickly as possible. If the problem is not resolved satisfactorily, you may ask for a conference with the SVP of Human Resources. You are encouraged to use Stack Fitness’s Open Door Policy to resolve any differences or disputes. We believe that most issues can be resolved in this manner. However, if you have attempted resolution but were unsuccessful through the Open Door Policy, you or the Company may submit any unresolved dispute involving legally protected rights to binding arbitration on an individual basis, pursuant to the Company’s Arbitration Program. No claim can be submitted as a class, consolidated, collective or representative action. For more information concerning this policy, please consult with the Human Resources Department. Concerns regarding possible harassment, ethical violations, or discrimination should be immediately reported to the Human Resources Department.",

        "Detail": "NONEXEMPT employees are hourly employees whose job positions do not meet FLSA or applicable state exemption tests, and who are not exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. Nonexempt employees are eligible to receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a given week, or as otherwise required by applicable state law. Stack Fitness’s nonexempt employees are required to submit a time record for each pay period, approved by the appropriate supervisor, for the purpose of tracking hours worked and calculating compensation. EXEMPT employees are employees whose job assignments meet specific tests established by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and state law and who are exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. Exempt employees are compensated on a salary basis. Employees will be informed whether their status is exempt or nonexempt and should consult a member of the Human Resources Team with any questions or concerns regarding this status. FULL-TIME employees are those who are not assigned temporary status and are regularly scheduled to an average of 30 hours per week or more. Full-time employees may be eligible for Stack Fitness’s benefits programs, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. PART-TIME employees are those who are regularly scheduled to work less than 30 hours per week. Part-time employees receive all legally mandated benefits such as workers’ compensation, Social Security benefits, and 401(k) eligibility. TEMPORARY employees are hired as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the workforce or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in this category are of a limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated period does not imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees are not eligible for employee benefits, except as required by applicable law, and may be classified as exempt or nonexempt on the basis of job duties and compensation. ACTIVE Full-time or part-time employees who receive wages from Stack Fitness for actual hours worked are classified as active. Full-time employees must maintain active employment status and work to be eligible for Stack Fitness’s benefits programs. INACTIVE Full-time or part-time employees who are temporarily not actively working are classified as inactive. For example, employees who are on leave of absence for any reason (see Leaves of Absence Policy) will be classified as “Inactive”. Benefits (PTO time and bonuses) are not accrued or earned while an employee is classified as inactive. Inactive status cannot exceed 12 weeks unless the employee is on a job protected leave providing more than 12 weeks of leave. (This does not apply to Worker’s Compensation Leaves.) Employees who will miss more than 2 weeks of work must be on an approved Leave of Absence.",

The department executive must approve any hiring of relatives. If already employed, relatives cannot be transferred into such a reporting relationship. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. Examples of relatives include, but are not limited to, the following: spouses, parents, children, brothers, sisters, brothers and sisters-in-law, fathers and mothers-in-law, step-parents, step-siblings, step-children, grandchildren and grandparents. If the relative relationship is established after employment, management will decide the most appropriate reporting relationship change that is in the best interest of the Company and its overall business functions. Employees are required to disclose a relative reporting relationship before the first date of employment or reassignment of position or work location. Failure to disclose the relationship constitutes falsifying of employment records. In cases where a conflict or the potential for conflict arises, even if there is no supervisory relationship involved, the parties may be separated by reassignment or employment may be terminated. Any questions regarding employment of relatives should be directed to the Human Resources Department.",

        "Title": "COUNSELING FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE",
        "Detail": "The normal counseling process consists of a verbal, written and final written warning, followed by termination if the deficiencies are not corrected with counseling, but the Company reserves the right to escalate the counseling process at any time based on the situation. Suspension should only be used in situations requiring further investigation, not to exceed a 30-day period, with Human Resources approval. As soon as possible after a performance problem has occurred, the supervisor will complete a Counseling Form, providing the following information where appropriate and send signed copies to the Human Resources Department for file. The Human Resources Department should be consulted regarding all final written warnings or terminations prior to discussing with the employee. When documenting employee counseling, the following should be included: Details of the performance deficiency or incident Specific details to define the performance problem requiring correction Recommended action by defining necessary behavior changes for performance improvement Policy and procedure compliance Any additional required training Consequences for lack of performance deficiency correction The first 90 days of employment for new hires or the first 90-days in a new position for existing employees is considered to be an introductory period. During this time, employees are evaluated to determine if they meet performance requirements. Employees who don't meet performance requirements may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Some cases of misconduct are not appropriate for this process due to the nature or severity of the situation. In these cases, termination may occur with or without any prior warnings; however, any termination must be pre-approved by the appropriate manager and Human Resources. Employee counseling should be an open-ended discussion, whereby the employee may ask questions and respond during the discussion. Should the employee disagree with any of the information contained in this counseling record the employee may submit a written statement explaining his or her position within 3 business days of the counseling session. The employee is asked to sign the form only as an acknowledgment that the supervisor's position and recommended action have been presented. If the employee refuses to sign the form, the supervisor should make a note of such and give the employee a copy of the form. If a witness is available to acknowledge refusal of signature and receipt of the form by the employee, that person should sign as a witness. Any questions regarding performance counseling procedures or the Counseling Form should be directed to the Human Resources Department.",

        "Title": "DEFINITIONS",
        "Detail": "Voluntary/Termination - A voluntary termination means an employee has made the decision to end the working relationship with the Company. Voluntary resignations include, but are not limited to, written or verbal resignation, retirement and job abandonment. An employee is considered to have abandoned his or her job if he or she fails to report to work for 3 consecutive scheduled work days without notice and has not notified the Company of his or her need for an excused absence, leave of absence or their intention to resign. Involuntary/Termination - A separation from the employment relationship for poor performance and/or issues that conflict with the policies set forth in this Employee Handbook or other policy document. All involuntary separations should have supporting documentation, Human Resources and management approval. Examples of supporting documentation may include, but are not limited to, counseling forms, incident reports, and transaction reports. Eligible for Rehire - A classification indicating that the separating employee would be considered for future employment at any Stack Fitness corporately owned location. Eligibility for rehire may offer the separating employee the option of returning to an Stack Fitness corporately owned location. Not Eligible for Rehire - A classification indicating that the separating employee would not be considered for future employment at Stack Fitness corporately owned locations. However, this classification does not prevent Stack Fitness Franchisee from considering future employment of the separating employee. Reduction in Workforce - While the Company hopes to continue growing and providing employment opportunities, business conditions, customer demand and other factors are unpredictable. Changes or downturns in any of these or other areas could create a need to restructure or reduce the number of people employed as well as to modify the types of positions within a specific department. In light of these uncertainties, it may become necessary for the Company at some time to conduct workforce reductions. Additionally, as the nature of Company changes, we may be faced with changing or even eliminating specific positions within the company. In such cases, individuals may be separated from the Company due to a lack of need for their particular position in the future. In such cases, the Company will make all efforts to place the affected employee into an available position within the Company. In the event that the Company determines to lay off any employee or a number of employees, the Company retains full discretion to select which employee(s) will be laid off. While the Company retains full discretion, some of the relevant factors the Company might consider include the Company's operational requirements and the skill, productivity, ability and past performance of the individuals involved. Employees are required to return all company property (e.g., computers, vehicles, passwords, uniforms, ID badges, credit cards) that is in their possession or control in the event of termination of employment, resignation, retirement or layoff or immediately upon request. When allowed by law, and in accordance with applicable law, the Company may withhold from the employee's paycheck the cost of any items that are not returned when required. No information belonging to the Company can be deleted, destroyed or copied for the employee's use. We may also take all action deemed appropriate to recover or protect company property. As noted previously, all employees are employed at-will and nothing in this handbook changes that status.",

The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities and talent that our employees invest in their work represents a significant part of not only our culture, but our reputation and our Company’s achievement as well. We embrace and encourage our employees’, member’s and franchisees’ differences in actual or perceived race, ethnicity, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, socioeconomic status, language, culture, marital status (including registered domestic partnership status), sexual orientation, sex and gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, lactation and related medical conditions), gender identity and gender expression (including transgender individuals who are transitioning, have transitioned, or are perceived to be transitioning to the gender with which they identify), age (40 or over), sexual orientation, Civil Air Patrol status, military and veteran status, immigration status, any other consideration protected by federal, state or local law and other characteristics that make them unique.

All employees are expected to exhibit conduct that reflects inclusion during work, at work functions on or off the work site, and at all other company-sponsored and participative events. Full inclusion pertains to letting people know that they, and their contributions, are valued. It includes interacting with people of all backgrounds respectfully and communicating to them an acceptance of their paths, perspectives, and preferences - which may be wholly unique or reflect those of groups of which they are members. Employees who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the company’s DEI policy and initiatives should seek assistance from a supervisor or a Human Resources representative.",

        "Title": "ATTENDANCE",
        "Detail": "Employees are expected to be regular in attendance and to be punctual. Any tardiness or absence causes problems for fellow employees and supervisors. If employees are absent, their workload must be performed by others, just as they must assume the workload of others who are absent. To limit problems caused by employee absences or tardiness, we have adopted the following policy that applies to absences not previously approved by the Company. Employees are expected to report to work as scheduled, be on time and be prepared to start work. Employees are also expected to remain at work for their entire work schedule, except for meal or break periods, or when required to leave on authorized company business or otherwise authorized to leave. Non-approved late arrivals, early departures or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and must be avoided. If employees are unable to report for work as scheduled on any particular date, they must contact their supervisor at least 2 hours or as soon as practical, before the time the employee is scheduled to begin working for a day or evening shift. If employees are unable to report as scheduled for an early morning or opening shift, they must contact their supervisor prior to 8pm the day before the scheduled shift. Providing notice after 8pm makes finding coverage for an early AM shift impractical and negatively impacts the studio and your fellow employees. The Company may inquire about the general reason for an absence or tardiness. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, employees must call in on any day they are scheduled to work but will not report to work. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, unless the absence or tardiness is legally protected. The following types of time off will not be considered grounds for disciplinary action under this policy: Excused time off, including vacation and other forms of paid time off; Approved leaves of absence, including jury duty leave, military leave and leave protected under the Family and Medical Leave Act or leaves pursuant to other federal, state or local laws; and/or Time off due to a work-related injury that is covered by workers' compensation. Each situation of absenteeism or tardiness will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Even one unexcused absence or tardiness may be considered excessive, depending upon the circumstances. Absent extraordinary circumstances, if employees fail to report for work without any notification to their supervisor and their absence continues for a period of 3 days, the Company will consider that the employee has abandoned and voluntarily terminated his or her employment. Notwithstanding these provisions, employees who are on an approved leave of absence will generally not be subject to corrective action as the result of absences.",

        "Title": "TIMEKEEPING",
        "Detail": "Stack Fitness is committed to ensuring that all employees are paid correctly and in accordance with federal, state and local laws as well as company policy and procedures. Employees who are classified as nonexempt must accurately record the time they work each day, including arrival, departure and meal break times. When employees receive their paychecks, via paper check, direct deposit or other payment method, they should verify immediately that their working time was recorded accurately and that they were paid correctly for all hours worked. Payroll detail information may be found directly on the pay stubs of paper checks and additional payroll history may be found in an employee’s UKG Pro account. Nonexempt employees must report all time worked and not work any time that is not authorized by their supervisors. This means nonexempt employees must not start work early, finish work late, work during a meal break, or perform any other extra or overtime work unless directed to do so. Employees who have questions about when or how many hours they are expected to work should contact their supervisor or a member of the Human Resources Team. Please also note the following with regard to work hours: Work schedules should be created in advance and it is the employee’s responsibility to know and follow your schedule. Employees are prohibited from deviating from their schedules without prior approval from their supervisor. Employee should clock in no sooner than 15 minutes before their shift begins and clock out when they finish work at the appropriate shift end time. Employees should obtain approval from their manager before continuing to work beyond the end of scheduled shift time. Employees must consistently punch in and out to track their hours in UltiPro. Should an employee miss a punch or otherwise need to have a punch corrected they should contact their supervisor and request the punch be corrected. When a supervisor corrects an employee’s punch, they must leave a note with details regarding why the punch was corrected. At the end of the payroll period and prior to “submitting” their timecard an employee should review the work hours reflected in their timecard and notify their supervisor of any issues with their punches. If an employee is not able to resolve a timekeeping issue with their supervisor, they should contact a member of the Human Resources or Payroll Team. It is a violation of the Company's policy for anyone to instruct or encourage another employee to work \"off the clock,\" to incorrectly report hours worked, or to alter another employee's time records. If any employee is directed or encouraged to incorrectly report hours worked, or to alter another employee's time records, the employee should report the incident immediately to a member of the Human Resources Team. It is important that you follow these policies. Failure to do so may result in incorrect pay as well as disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Exempt Employees Employees who are classified as exempt must record absences from work for reasons such as leaves of absence, sick leave or vacation. Exempt employees are paid on a salary basis. This means the employee regularly receives a predetermined amount of compensation each pay period, which cannot be reduced because of variations in the quality or quantity of the employee's work. In general, an exempt employee will receive their salary for any week in which the employee performs any work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked. However, an exempt employee will not be paid for days not worked in the following circumstances: When an exempt employee takes one or more full days off for personal reasons other than sickness or disability, the employee will not be paid for such day(s) of absence, but the employee may use available Paid Time Off (PTO) to make up for the reduction in salary; When an exempt employee takes one or more full days off from work due to sickness or disability, the employee will not be paid for such day(s) of absence, but the employee may use Paid Time Off (PTO) to make up for the reduction in salary; When an exempt employee works only part of the week during their first and last week with the Company, the employee will be paid only for the days actually worked; When an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or corresponding laws, the Company will not pay for such days/hours of absence; and The Company may require an exempt employee to use available paid time off, as a replacement for salary, when the employee takes less than a full day off from work. An exempt employee's salary will not be reduced when the employee works part of a week and misses part of a week due to service as a juror, witness or in the military or for lack of work, though deductions may be made to offset amounts an employee receives as jury or witness fees, or for military pay. It is company policy to comply with the salary basis requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law. The Company prohibits any deductions from pay that violate the FLSA or applicable state law. If an exempt employee believes that an improper deduction has been made to their salary, the employee should immediately report this information to Human Resources, a supervisor or Payroll. Reports of improper deductions will be promptly investigated. If it is determined that an improper deduction has occurred, the employee will be promptly reimbursed for any improper deduction made.",

When the Legal Department determines that a legal hold should be issued, the Legal Department will notify appropriate personnel via email that a legal hold has been issued. All personnel receiving the legal hold notice must acknowledge via email that they understand a legal hold is in place. It is the manager’s responsibility to ensure that the Legal Department is notified of all persons with relevant knowledge. Once a legal hold has been issued, all documents related to the legal hold must be preserved, including: drafts, informal files, desk files, e-mails, voicemails, handwritten notes, faxes, memos, forms, calendar entries, notes and lists. These documents must be preserved whether they are electronic or paper, or whether they are on an employee’s hard drive or personal or shared computer or any other location where the employee stores information, including the employee’s home computer and any hand-held computing device. Any destruction of documents occurring under Stack Fitness’s document retention policies will be suspended. Personnel will be notified when the legal hold has been removed. Only at that time can employees delete or destroy any information that was the subject of the legal hold. Any questions regarding employment applications, personnel files, personnel data changes, employment reference checks or company documents should be directed to the Human Resources Department. In addition to promotion opportunities, Stack Fitness encourages employees to apply for new or vacated positions. Stack Fitness has the sole discretion to rehire former employees who apply for open positions.",

        "Title": "TRANSFER REQUESTS",
        "Detail": "It is recommended that an employee complete his/her introductory period before applying for a new or vacated position. The following is the procedure for employees who would like to transfer from one department, position or studio region to another: An employee applies for a position via OTrecruit and advises Talent Acquisition or Human Resources of the application. The application request is reviewed by Talent Acquisition. Talent Acquisition conducts an interview with the employee. If the employee is determined to be a qualified candidate for the position, Human Resources will then notify the department managers of the employee’s interest. As a part of this determination, employee may be evaluated against other internal employees or external applicants. If the employee is selected, the Human Resources Team and current supervisor arrange an appropriate transition time frame. If the Human Resources Team and current supervisor disagree about the transition time frame, they will elevate their concerns to executive management. If an employee is not able to commit to and/or meet the specified transition time, the transfer request may be denied or a previously approved request may be canceled. Employees are not eligible for transfer or promotion if: the employee has recent coaching for improved performance on file; or the employee has a documented pattern of uncorrected performance deficiencies. If a part-time employee is hired into a full-time position, the beginning date of the full-time position becomes the employee's benefit date for the purpose of accruing certain benefits.",

        "Title": "OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT",
        "Detail": "The Company respects each employee's right to engage in activities outside of employment such as those that are of a personal or private nature, to the extent that such activities do not create a conflict of interest as described in the Conflicts of Interest policy set forth in this Handbook or adversely affect the employee's ability to perform his or her job. Under certain circumstances, if an employee's personal conduct begins to adversely affect his or her performance on the job, or begins to make it impossible for him or her to carry out any or all of his or her job duties while at work, appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment may be appropriate. An example of an activity that might adversely affect an employee's ability to perform his or her job duties is outside employment. While the Company does not prohibit employees from holding other jobs, the following types of outside employment are prohibited: Employment that conflicts with the employee's work schedule, duties and responsibilities or creates an actual conflict of interest; Employment that impairs or has a detrimental effect on the employee's work performance with the Company; Employment that requires employees to conduct work or related activities during working times or using any of the Company's tools, materials or equipment; and Employment that directly or indirectly competes with the business or the interests of the Company. For the purposes of this policy, self-employment is considered outside employment. The Company will not assume any responsibility for employees' outside employment. Specifically, Stack Fitness will not provide workers' compensation coverage or any other benefit for injuries occurring from, or arising out of, such outside employment. Any questions regarding outside employment should be directed to the immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department.",

        "Detail": "A whistleblower, as defined by this policy, is an employee of Stack Fitness who reports an activity that he/she considers to be illegal or dishonest to one or more of the parties specified in this policy. The whistleblower is not responsible for investigating the activity or for determining fault or corrective measures; appropriate management officials are charged with these responsibilities. Examples of illegal or dishonest activities are violations of federal, state or local laws; billing for services not performed or for goods not delivered; and other fraudulent financial reporting. If an employee has knowledge of or a concern of illegal or dishonest fraudulent activity, the employee is to contact his/her immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department. The employee must exercise sound judgment to avoid baseless allegations. An employee who intentionally files a false report of wrongdoing will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination. Whistleblower protections are provided in two important areas – confidentiality, and against retaliation. Insofar as possible, the confidentiality of the whistleblower will be maintained. However, identity may have to be disclosed to conduct a thorough investigation, to comply with the law, and to provide accused individuals their legal rights of defense. The Company will not retaliate against a whistleblower. This includes, but is not limited to, protection from retaliation in the form of an adverse employment action such as termination, compensation decreases, or poor work assignments and threats of physical harm. Any whistleblower who believes he/she is being retaliated against should contact the Human Resources Department immediately. The right of a whistleblower for protection against retaliation does not include immunity for any personal wrongdoing that is alleged and investigated. All reports of illegal and dishonest activities will be promptly submitted to the Human Resources Manager, who is responsible for investigating and coordinating corrective action.

When incurring expenses on behalf of Stack Fitness employees are expected to exercise prudence and sound business judgment in their expenditure of company and customer financial resources. Expenditures of a personal nature are not the responsibility of the Company and, accordingly will not be reimbursed. Moreover, submitting documentation for the reimbursement of personal expenses will make an employee subject to disciplinary action. These policies and guidelines should assist employees in making their spending decisions. Primary responsibility for determining the appropriateness of expenses rests with the employee and their manager. However, this responsibility must be exercised within the expectations of the Company. To be eligible for reimbursement, expenses must be: Ordinary Reasonable Necessary Substantiated through appropriate documentation and record keeping Directly related to the conduct of company business Prompt submission of approved expense reports for travel and other business expenses are the responsibility of the employee. The approved expense report should be submitted to Accounts Payable no later than 14 days following the date on which the expense was incurred. The company recognizes that this may not always be possible, nevertheless, any expenses submitted after more than thirty (30) days from the conclusion of the business trip will need additional approvals from executive management of Stack Fitness before payment is made.",

        "Title": "AUTOMOBILE RENTAL",
        "Detail": "Employees are expected to use the most economical ground transportation appropriate under the circumstances and should generally use the following, in this order of desirability: Courtesy Cars Many hotels have courtesy cars, which will take you to and from the airport at no charge. The hotel will generally have a well-marked courtesy phone at the airport if this service is available. Employees should take advantage of this free service whenever possible. Airport Shuttle or Bus Airport shuttles or buses generally travel to and from all major hotels for a small fee. At major airports such services are as quick as a taxi and considerably less expensive. Airport shuttle or bus services are generally located near the airport’s baggage claim area. Taxis/Uber/Lyft When courtesy cars and airport shuttles are not available, a taxi is often the next most economical and convenient form of transportation when the trip is for a limited time and minimal mileage is involved. A taxi may also be the most economical mode of transportation between an individual’s home and the airport. Rental Cars Car rentals are expensive so other forms of transportation should be considered when practical. Employees will be allowed to rent a car while out of town provided that advance approval has been given by the individual’s supervisor and that the cost is less than alternative methods of transportation. Employees must refuel the rented automobile before returning the car. This will avoid the significantly higher charge that auto rental companies assess to refuel the car. If an accident occurs while an employee is traveling in a rented car, the employee must contact the Human Resources Department as soon as reasonably possible. Personal Cars Employees are compensated for use of their personal cars when used for Company business. When individuals use their personal car for such travel, including travel to and from the airport, mileage will be allowed at the currently approved IRS rate per mile. In the case of individuals using their personal cars to take a trip that would normally be made by air, (e.g., Fort Lauderdale to Tampa) mileage will be allowed at the currently approved rate; however, the total mileage reimbursement will not exceed the sum of the  lowest available round trip coach airfare. Where a personal automobile is used in lieu of flying primarily for the personal convenience of the employee, the reimbursement is limited to the lesser of the mileage allowance (standard mileage rate x no. of miles driven) or the applicable discount coach airfare. Stack Fitness is not responsible for damages to personal vehicles during business use. The employee is responsible for maintaining insurance coverage and for any deductible under that coverage. Fuel and other maintenance costs, such as oil changes, will not be reimbursed when a personal auto is used for business; fuel costs are included as a component of the standard mileage rate. Parking/Tolls Parking and toll expenses, including charges for hotel parking, incurred by Employee traveling on Company business will be reimbursed. The costs of parking tickets, fines, car washes, valet service, etc., are the responsibility of the Employee and will not be reimbursed. On-Airport Parking is permitted for short business trips. For extended trips, Employee should use off-airport facilities.",

In addition, entertainment expenses must be for legitimate business purposes. Detailed documentation for any such expense must be provided, including: Date and place of entertainment Nature of expense Names, titles and corporate affiliation of those entertained Vendor receipts (not credit card receipts or statements) showing the vendor’s name, description of the services provided, date, total expenses including tips (if applicable)",

        "Detail": "Stack Fitness understands that in the course of normal business operations, Nonexempt employees may be called upon to travel with the Company.  It is for this reason that the Company outlines the compensation guidelines below specific to Nonexempt associates.  The compensation guidelines outlined in this policy apply except where state law requires otherwise. Procedure Nonexempt employees must be compensated for time spent traveling based on the following guidelines: Normal commute/travel time to work is not compensated. Single-day, out-of-town travel time is considered compensable time, excluding commute home-to-work travel time (this includes alternate work site). Overnight out-of-town travel time is compensated when it is within the employee’s regular workday.  This is true for hours worked on regular working days during normal working hours and during the corresponding hours on nonworking days.  Time spent traveling to an airport terminal or train station is not treated as hours worked.  By contrast, all time spent waiting at the terminal until arrival at the destination is compensable. Regular meal period time is not considered compensable time while traveling. If an employee must commute/travel to a location outside of his/her normal place of work to fulfill work requirements, that actual travel time may or may not be compensated as outlined below: If the travel is within the hours of the employee’s normal workday, it is compensated. If the travel is outside of normal work hours and is on a common carrier (e.g., airline, train) or the employee is a passenger in a vehicle other than a common carrier AND work is performed, the travel time is compensated. If the travel time is outside of normal work hours and is on a common carrier or the employee is a passenger in a vehicle other than a common carrier and no work is performed, the travel time is not compensated. If an employee travels on a one-day assignment, such as travel from one gym to another during working hours, the time is compensated. If travel time is outside of normal working hours and the employee is required to drive, the time is compensated. The employee will be reimbursed for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred in carrying out your work duties during travel in accordance with the guidelines outlined in this policy. When factoring in the compensation guidelines outlined above, it is important to calculate the potential overtime associated with nonexempt travel and budget accordingly.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the nonexempt employee does not incur overtime as a result of their planned travel. Nonexempt employees are expected to adhere to all requirements outlined in this including:",

        "Detail": "Timely and accurate expense reporting is necessary to manage the expenditures of the Company and ensure the prompt reimbursement of approved employee expenses.  In order to facilitate the expense reimbursement process, it is the employee's responsibility to provide receipts or other supporting documentation substantiating all claimed business expenditures. Strict adherence to the following Expense Reporting Guidelines will ensure that employee reimbursements are processed in the most expeditious manner possible and reduce the possibility of nonpayment of expense claims. Employees must use Stack Fitness’s partner, Concur, for tracking and processing all company approved business travel expenses.  Concur provides a cell phone app which allows employees to easily scan and process their business-related expenses to create an expense report for processing through the Accounting Department. For personal car usage on company business, local transportation charges are reimbursed at a flat rate set by the IRS, which includes reimbursement for gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, etc. Meals, entertainment, and other expense charges must be segregated by day on the expense report. Employees must upload copies of itemized original receipts of bills to Concur, our expense management system, for all claimed business expenses. Detailed bills in addition to credit card charge slips should be provided when available. In the event a valid receipt is misplaced, it is the employee's responsibility to request a replacement copy from the requisite vendor. A written explanation and affidavit of valid business expenses will be accepted only after the employee has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain replacement copies. Business meal expenses require a detailed listing of attendees, customer name and company name as required by the IRS. Meal charges should be reported separately from travel and lodging expenses since the tax deductibility treatment and reporting requirements associated with these types of expenses differs from other expenses and are subject to periodic review by the IRS. The employee must sign and submit his/her Expense Report through Stack Fitness’s Concur software certifying amounts included for reimbursement were actually incurred for business purposes and are reasonable. Signature from supervisor must be obtained before submitting Expense Report to Accounting. Managers are responsible for reviewing and approving the expenses submitted by their department. Their familiarity with departmental operations ensures that expenses are not submitted which do not have a valid business purpose. Expense Report approvers bear the responsibility for ensuring compliance with this policy, and are required to authorize, by signature, the expense reports subsequent to the completion of their review.  Managers are required to have expense reports approved by noon on the Monday before payroll pay date for the expense reports to be eligible for reimbursement for that week’s payroll run. The Accounting Department will perform a final review of expense documentation and policy compliance before payment of the claimed expenses; however, it is the responsibility of each employee and the supervisor approving the Expense Report to ensure that the Stack Fitness expense reporting process requirements are followed. Accounting's final review will include a comparison of expenses submitted for reimbursement to ensure the reasonableness of costs claimed.  During this review process, the Accounting Department is authorized to return any questionable or incomplete reports to the employee in order to obtain additional approval or documentation to support the reported expenses. Expense reports should be submitted no more than once per payroll period when expecting reimbursement through payroll, and once per month for those employees using a company credit card.  When preparing an Employee Expense Report using Concur, payment type of “Cash” should be used when the employee is submitting for reimbursement of his/her expenses. The “Company Paid” option is required for all expenses incurred on a company credit card. Expense reports should be submitted no later than 1 week from payroll pay date. If a payroll report is submitted and approved within the required time, the employee will be reimbursed on his/her next paycheck. Other Expenses Reasonable and necessary gratuities that are not covered under meals may be reimbursed. Additionally, emergency secretarial work and/or postal charges incurred are reimbursable for the purpose of work on behalf of the Company. Internet access for business purposes at hotel will be reimbursed by Company. Non-reimbursable Expenditures The Company maintains a strict policy that expenses in any category that could be perceived as lavish or excessive will not be reimbursed. Expenses that are not reimbursable include, but are not limited to: Alcoholic beverages are not reimbursable unless pre-approved by a C-Level Executive and only then one drink per individual will be reimbursed. Travel insurance and related expenses including but not limited to car rental insurance, bag insurance, airline ticket insurance, upgrades, early bird seating, first class and special seating (i.e. aisle/exit row), etc. When lodging accommodations have been arranged by the Company and the individual elects to stay elsewhere, reimbursement is made at the amount no higher than the rate negotiated by the Company. Airline Club Memberships WiFi/Internet access on plane Limousine travel Clothing purchases Business conferences & entertainment which are not approved by Employee’s Supervisor. Gifts to staff members (including flowers). The Company will purchase these items when appropriate. Staff-related lunches and gatherings which are not work-related. Those that include spouses are not considered work-related. Valets Service Car washes Toiletry articles Parking tickets, vehicle repair costs, fines, speeding tickets and towing charges Spa Charges Expenses for spouses, friends or relatives. If a spouse, friend or relative accompanies Employee on a business trip, it is the responsibility of the Employee to pay for any added cost for double occupancy and all related expenses. Employee must make the appropriate adjustment on Expense Report.",

        "Title": "SAFE HARBOR POLICY FOR EXEMPT EMPLOYEES",
        "Detail": "It is Stack Fitness’s policy and practice to accurately compensate employees and to do so in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws. To ensure that you are paid properly and that no improper deductions are made, you must review your pay stubs promptly to identify and report all errors. If you are classified as an exempt salaried employee, you will receive a salary which is intended to compensate you for all hours you may work for the Company. This salary will be established at the time of hire or when you become classified as an exempt employee. While it may be subject to review and modification from time to time, such as during salary review times, the salary will be a predetermined amount that will not be subject to deductions for variations in the quantity or quality of work performed. Under federal and state law, your salary is subject to certain deductions. For example, unless state law requires otherwise, your salary can be reduced for the following reasons: Full-day absences for personal reasons Full-day absences for sickness or disability Full-week disciplinary suspensions for infractions of our written policies and procedures Family and Medical Leave absences (either full- or partial-day absences) To offset amounts received as payment from the court for jury and witness fees or from the military as military pay The first or last week of employment in the event you work less than a full week Any full work week in which you do not perform any work Your salary may also be reduced for certain types of deductions such as your portion of health, dental or life insurance premiums; state, federal or local taxes; Social Security; or voluntary contributions to a 401(k) or pension plan. In any work week in which you performed any work, your salary will not be reduced for any of the following reasons: Partial day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability Your absence on a day because your employer has decided to close a facility on a scheduled work day Absences for jury duty, attendance as a witness, or military leave in any week in which you have performed any work (subject to any offsets as set forth above) Any other deductions prohibited by state or federal law However, unless state law provides otherwise, deductions may be made to your accrued leave for full- or partial-day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability. If you believe you have been subject to any improper deductions, you should immediately report the matter to your supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or if you believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person (or if you have not received a prompt and fully acceptable reply), you should immediately contact a member of the Payroll or Human Resources Team.",

Performance appraisals will assess the employee's performance for a specific period of time and in some cases may provide the basis for merit-based pay adjustments. This policy applies to all full-time, part-time, exempt and nonexempt employees. Supervisors and employees should discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. It is the supervisor's responsibility to conduct formal performance appraisals according to Stack Fitness’s Performance Appraisal Schedule to provide both the supervisor and the employee the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify areas requiring performance improvement, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting performance goals.

For more information, please contact the Human Resources Department. If an employee believes an appraisal is past due, it is the employee's responsibility to bring it to the attention of the supervisor. The employee should report a continual delay of a formal performance appraisal to the Human Resources Department. Any questions regarding performance appraisals should be directed to the immediate supervisor or to the Human Resources Department.",

        "Detail": "The health and safety of employees and others on Company property are of critical concern to Stack Fitness. We strive to attain the highest possible level of safety in all activities and operations. The Company also intends to comply with all health and safety laws applicable to our business. To this end, the Company must rely upon our employees to ensure that work areas are kept safe and free of hazardous conditions. Employees should be conscientious about workplace safety including proper operating methods and known dangerous conditions or hazards. Employees should report any unsafe conditions or potential hazards to a supervisor immediately, even if they believe they have corrected the problem. If an employee suspects a concealed danger is present on Company premises or in a product, facility, piece of equipment, process or business practice for which the Company is responsible, the employee must immediately bring it to the attention of his or her supervisor. Supervisors should immediately arrange for the correction of any unsafe condition or concealed danger and should contact a member of the Human Resources Team regarding the problem. Employees who develop an injury or illness or are on a medication that impairs their physical or mental ability may be a risk to themselves, other employees or our members. Employees are therefore prohibited from reporting to work if they have an injury or physical limitation that might prevent them from meeting all of the requirements found on their job description, unless previously approved to work by our Payroll and Benefits Manager. Any employee who is currently on a medication, either over the counter or prescribed, that impairs their physical or mental abilities is also prohibited from reporting to work without approval from the Payroll and Benefits Manager. Employees who find they have a limitation may be eligible for a leave of absence or temporary work modification. Please contact our Payroll and Benefits Manager and see our Leaves of Absence and Modified Duty policies for additional information. Additionally, the Company has developed a written Injury and Illness Prevention Program as required by law. Employees may receive a copy of this program by contacting the Human Resources Team. It is employees' responsibility to read, understand and observe the Injury and Illness Prevention Program provisions applicable to their job. Any workplace injury, accident or illness must be reported to an employee's supervisor as soon as possible, regardless of the severity of the injury or accident. If medical attention is required immediately, supervisors will assist employees in medical care, after which the details of the injury or accident must be reported to the Stack Fitness Corporate Office using the Incident Report Form which can be found on our internal SharePoint site or by request from the Human Resources Department.

The Company also reserves the right to actively monitor, through its surveillance cameras, any areas for safety reasons (to protect against equipment failure, breakage, or accident) or confidentiality reasons (to protect documents or other proprietary information). Although the video surveillance described in this policy is intended to monitor for security incidents and other safety reasons at the Company, it is possible that such surveillance may monitor activities not related to the Company's business. The Company respects the privacy of its employees. Accordingly, no video cameras will be installed in the Company's restrooms or in any lactation or changing areas. The surveillance cameras and any video footage from the surveillance are to be used solely for the purposes of this video surveillance policy. Any unauthorized use of these video cameras and/or video recordings is strictly forbidden and may result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.",

Employees are not required to make a complaint directly to their immediate supervisor. Supervisors and managers who receive complaints of misconduct are required to immediately report such complaints to a member of the Human Resources Team who will attempt to resolve issues internally. In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct themselves, supervisors and managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual harassment or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual harassment to continue. When a report is received, the Company will conduct a fair, timely, thorough and objective investigation that provides all parties appropriate due process and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected. The Company expects all employees to fully cooperate with any investigation conducted by the Company into a complaint of proscribed harassment, discrimination or retaliation or regarding the alleged violation of any other Company policies. The Company will maintain confidentiality surrounding the investigation to the extent possible and to the extent permitted under applicable federal and state law. Upon completion of the investigation, the Company will communicate its conclusion as soon as practical. If the Company determines that this policy has been violated, remedial action will be taken, commensurate with the severity of the offense, up to and including termination of employment. Appropriate action will also be taken to deter any such conduct in the future.

The Company reserves the right to monitor or inspect an employee’s workplace activities (including activity on personal sites that may have been accessed during working time, from work locations, or using work devices) upon reasonable suspicion of a violation of this policy or of other Company policies. Employees should be conscious about how they present themselves in any public forum, including a social networking site, and must recognize that the line between personal and professional is often indistinct in the eyes of Stack Fitness franchisees, members, vendors and business partners. If an employee’s personal account does connect the employee to the Company in some manner, or if an employee’s personal site is identified as that of a Company employee, the employee should exercise appropriate judgment. The Company expects that employees will comply with the following standards of conduct in regard to any personal social networking sites: Maintain the confidentiality of the trade secrets and proprietary business information of the Company and its business partners.  Trade secrets may include information regarding the development of systems, processes, products, know-how and technology.  Do not post internal reports, policies, procedures, or other internal business-related confidential communication. Maintain the highest regard for the privacy interests of members and coworkers Uphold the Company’s values of courtesy and respect for other individuals and the avoidance of defamatory or disparaging comments about members, franchisees, other employees, business partners, and even the Company’s competitors. Avoid statements or materials that are reflective of illegal, sexually graphic, discriminatory, obscene, or violent activities. Do not create a link from a personal blog, website, or other social networking site to any company website without identifying yourself as an Stack Fitness employee. Express only your personal opinions.  Never represent yourself as a spokesperson for Stack Fitness. Refrain from using social media while on work time or on equipment provided by the Company unless it is work-related as authorized by your manager or consistent with this policy.  Do not use company email addresses to register on social networks, blogs, or other online tools for personal use. This policy will be interpreted and enforced in compliance with applicable state and local laws and is not intended to give rise to adverse consequences to employees due to lawful off-duty conduct that is unrelated to workplace concerns or unrelated to the Company.",

        "Title": "SECURITY",
        "Detail": "Stack Fitness prohibits illegal activity of any kind by employees, customers or business associates. Theft or unauthorized possession of property of employees, customers or business associates is prohibited.  While Stack Fitness’s standard is to maintain a safe and protective business environment for employees, customers and business associates, Stack Fitness cannot be responsible for employees, customers or business associates’ personal property while on company premises. To help ensure a safe, healthy and productive work environment, Stack Fitness reserves the right to carry out reasonable searches of individuals for cause and/or to use electronic surveillance equipment. Stack Fitness may initiate a reasonable search of an individual and his or her personal effects at random without prior announcement and at such times and locations as deemed appropriate. Stack Fitness prohibits the possession, transfer, purchase, sale or use of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms, explosives or other dangerous materials in the workplace or on company premises. Approval from Corporate Human Resources in advance of a security inspection is required. This policy is particularly directed at inspections for cause of employees' personal effects (such as lunch containers, purses, bags and automobiles) as well as company-issued effects (all computer systems and data, vehicles, etc.). All information produced, transmitted, stored or retrieved from any Stack Fitness computer system is classified as company property and may be used as evidence in any business-related investigation. All employees are expected to cooperate fully in such inspections. Failure to cooperate may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. In the case of a random or routine inspection for safety and security purposes, any property of the employee or company property in possession of the employee may be subject to an inspection. Random or routine inspection does not suggest suspicion or a violation of policy, and no stigma should be attached to individuals involved in random inspections.

In most cases, active shooters use firearms(s), and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims. Quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your own life. Remember that customers and clients are likely to follow the lead of employees and managers during an active shooter situation. 1. RUN If there is an accessible escape path, attempt to evacuate the premises. Be sure to: Have an escape route and plan in mind Evacuate, regardless of whether others agree to follow Leave your belongings behind Help others escape, if possible Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be Keep your hands visible Follow the instructions of any police officers Do not attempt to move wounded people Call 911 when you are safe 2. HIDE If evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less likely to find you. Your hiding place should: Be out of the active shooter’s view Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., an office with a closed and locked door) Not trap you or restrict your options for movement To prevent an active shooter from entering your hiding place: Lock the door Blockade the door with heavy furniture If the active shooter is nearby: Lock the door Silence your cell phone and/or pager Turn off any source of noise (i.e., radios, televisions) Hide behind large items (i.e., cabinets, desks) Remain quiet If evacuation and hiding out are not possible: Remain calm Dial 911, if possible, to alert police to the active shooter’s location If you cannot speak, leave the line open and allow the dispatcher to listen",

        "Title": "PAID TIME OFF",
        "Detail": "Stack Fitness recognizes the need for an Employee to have compensated time-off periods for the purpose of rest and relaxation. Stack Fitness grants Paid Time Off (PTO) to active full-time employees as the terms are defined in Stack Fitness’ Employment Categories Policy.  PTO is paid at the employee’s base pay rate at the time the PTO is used. It does not include overtime or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, or bonuses. Paid Time Off (PTO) is an all-purpose time off policy for all full-time employees to use as vacation time and/or incidental time due to sickness or to handle personal affairs. It combines traditional vacation and sick leave plans into one flexible, paid time off policy. Full-time employees accrue paid time off as follows: Employee will begin accruing PTO on their hire date; however, employee cannot use their PTO until after their 60th day of employment. Any time off taken during the initial 60-days of employment will be unpaid. In-studio employees will accumulate PTO at a rate of 3.08 hours per pay period regardless of their length of service. Corporate office and regional management employees will accumulate PTO at a rate of 6.16 hours per pay period regardless of their length of service. In 2020 our payroll system is set up to calculate an employee’s PTO accrual level with a maximum cap never to exceed 25 PTO days (or 200 hours) for corporate office and regional management employees and 15 PTO days (or 120 hours) for in-studio employees. Employees’ PTO will continue to accrue until it reaches its max cap at which time accrual will stop until the employee elects to use some of their accrued balance. Employees may carry over a maximum of 120 hours of PTO, unless state law requires otherwise. If more than 120 hours are left at the end of the year that time will be lost. This is intended to encourage employee to use their PTO to establish a healthy work life balance and allows the company to manage its financial obligations responsibly. When requesting PTO, employee must notify their immediate supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance of the requested time off if the need is foreseeable. If the need for PTO is unforeseeable then notice must be given as soon as practicable. Every effort will be made to grant employee’s request, consistent with our operating schedule. However, if too many people request the same period of time off or business operations would be significantly impacted, Company reserves the right to choose who may take time off during that period, if allowed by state law. Individuals with the longest length of service generally will be given preference; however, both seniority and priority are taken into consideration for PTO requests which will be determined by Senior Management if conflicting requests are received. If employee will be out of work due to illness or to any other emergency for which notice could not be provided, employee must call in and notify their supervisor as early as possible, but at least by the start of your workday. If employee calls in sick for three (3) or more consecutive days, employee may be required to provide their supervisor with a doctor's note on the day they return to work unless prohibited by state law. Paid time off may be used at a minimum of 2-hour increments. If possible, the Company asks all employees to avoid requesting time off during the following ongoing yearly events: Summit and our Annual Convention. Any advanced, but unaccrued PTO may be deducted from employee’s final paycheck, to the extent permitted by law. Accumulated PTO may be used to supplement military leave, jury duty, witness duty, holidays and bereavement leave. Company will pay out up to 2-weeks (80-hours) of an employee’s accrued and unused PTO (excluding Charity and Birthday PTO for HQ employees) upon their voluntary separation from the company unless the employee is terminated for Job Abandonment, resigns within their 90-day Introductory Period or local law provides a greater benefit, in which case local law will apply. If an employee resigns and elects to use any PTO within their notice period, any PTO hours used will be deducted from the 80-hours provided for a voluntary separation. Employees who are involuntarily separated from the company will have their accrued and unused PTO paid out in full upon separation. Aside from the payout upon an employee’s termination described above, employees are not able to “cash-out” unused PTO for a monetary payout in lieu of actually using PTO to take time off. Employees who are unable to report to work must notify their supervisor before the scheduled start of their shift. Employees must notify the supervisor directly. If the supervisor cannot be contacted, the next higher level of management should be notified directly. Advising a non-supervisory employee, requesting another person to notify the supervisor, or leaving a message, is not an acceptable notice of absence. The employee is responsible for following these procedures for every day of absence, unless on an approved leave of absence. Failure to follow procedures for reporting absences is considered a violation of policy and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Doctor’s notes may be required, however, those absences due to illness may still be considered when determining an employee’s performance in relation to attendance. Unauthorized absence may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. For part time employees in areas that require specific Safe and Sick Time policies, such as New York City, please see the State Specific Policies section for your state at the end of this handbook for detailed information on your Safe and Sick Time benefit. Any questions regarding time off should be directed to the immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department.",

If a recognized holiday falls on a weekend day, it is usually observed on the preceding Friday or the following Monday. Holiday observance will be announced in advance, or it will be the discretion of the executive team as to what hours are worked and paid for on either Friday or Monday. Full time non-exempt corporate office employees who are authorized to work on an observed holiday, when their work location would otherwise be closed, receive pay for all hours worked plus are given an additional 8-hour PTO paid day added to their Employee PTO Bank. Exempt corporate office employees who work on an observed holiday will receive another day off upon their supervisor’s approval. If a holiday falls within a jury duty or bereavement leave, the eligible employee will be paid for the holiday (at the regular straight-time rate) in addition to the leave day, or the eligible employee will receive an additional day off at the option of the Company. Holiday pay is not counted for the purpose of calculating an employee's overtime hours of work or overtime premiums.",

Exempt employees will receive full pay for any week in which they performed work for the Company and missed work due to jury service.  Accrued time off may be requested to supplement jury duty exceeding this time. Applicable federal and/or state law will take precedent in determining whether additional jury duty qualifies as paid leave. Employees must present an original jury duty summons to their supervisor and the Payroll Department immediately upon receipt and include notice of any fees received for jury duty service. Employees are expected to keep management informed of the expected length of jury duty service. The employee is expected to report for work after being dismissed from jury duty and provide verification of jury duty attendance. If the required absence presents a serious conflict for management, the employee may be asked to try to postpone jury duty. Any questions regarding jury duty should be directed to the immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department.",

        "Title": "MILITARY SERVICE DUTY",
        "Detail": "Stack Fitness is committed to protecting the job rights of employees absent on military leave. In accordance with federal and state law, it is the Company's policy that no employee or prospective employee will be subjected to any form of discrimination on the basis of that person's application for membership, membership in, or obligation to perform service for any of the Uniformed Services of the United States. Specifically, no person will be denied employment, reemployment, promotion, or other benefit of employment on the basis of such membership. Furthermore, no person will be subjected to retaliation or adverse employment action because such person has exercised his or her rights under this policy. If any employee believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination in violation of this policy, the employee should contact a Human Resources representative. A. Uniformed Services: The \"uniformed services\" consist of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard; the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve; the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard; the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service; and any other category of persons designated by the President of the United States in time of war or emergency. B. Military Service: Military service means the performance of such military duty on a commission or no- commission status, and on a voluntary or involuntary basis, in a uniformed service, including active duty; active duty for training; initial active duty for training; inactive duty training; full-time National Guard duty; absence from work for an examination to determine a person's fitness for any of the above forms of duty; and funeral honors by National Guard or reserve members. C. Notice of Need for Leave: Employees desiring military leave must provide advance written notice to Human Resources, unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity. Notice may be provided by the employee or by an appropriate officer of the branch of the military service in which the employee will be serving.  In some circumstances, lack of timely notice could disqualify an employee from the requested leave and reemployment rights. D.  Duration/Nature of Leave:  The cumulative length of an employee’s absences from employment may not exceed 5 years, subject to certain types of service that are exempt from this limitation.  Only the time the employee actually spends in uniformed services counts toward the 5-year limit.  Military leave is unpaid.  To the extent employees are eligible for vacation or similar paid leave, they are permitted, but not required, to request that Stack Fitness apply the paid leave to the military service.  In addition, employees are entitled to the seniority rights accorded other similarly situated individuals on non-military leaves of absence. E.  Benefits: Employees who are on duty for more than 30 days may elect to continue employer-sponsored health care for themselves and their families for up to 24 months, similar to COBRA, but they may be required to pay up to 102% of the full premium.  Stack Fitness shall provide health care coverage of less than 31 days to the same extent as if the employee out on military leave had not taken leave.  Upon an employee’s return from military service, Stack Fitness will reinstate health insurance coverage without any waiting period or exclusion for preexisting conditions, other than what would have applied ordinarily.  This rule will not apply to the coverage of any illness or injury determined by the Secretary of Veteran Affairs to have been incurred in or aggravated during the employee’s performance of military duty. For purposes of Stack Fitness’s retirement plan, military duty is counted as covered service with the employer for benefit accrual purposes.  Employees are treated as if they have been continuously employed.  Reemployed employees are permitted a period equal to three times the period of military duty or 5 years, whichever ends first, to make up 401(k) contributions.  If the employee makes up the contributions, Stack Fitness shall make up any matching contributions identified in Stack Fitness’s benefits plan. F.  Notice by Returning Employees:  An employee who wishes to return to work after military leave must notify Human Resources in a timely manner unless timely reporting back or application was unreasonable or impossible.  In addition to timely notice, to be eligible for reemployment, the employee must have been released from military service under honorable conditions. G.  Reemployment Rights: Upon an employee's prompt application for reemployment (as defined below), an employee will be reinstated to employment in the following manner depending upon the employee's period of military service: Less than 91 days of military service - (a) in a position that the employee would have attained if employment had not been interrupted by military service; or (b) if found not qualified for such position, in the same or similar position in which the employee had been employed prior to military service.  The employee will be entitled to the same seniority, status, and pay, as well as any other rights and benefits determined by seniority. If the returning employee cannot qualify for the position he/she would have attained absent military service, he/she will be reemployed if qualified in any other position that is the nearest approximation to that position. More than 90 days and less than 5 years of military leave - (a) in a position that the employee would have attained if employment had not been interrupted by military service or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the employee is qualified to perform; or (b) if found not qualified by the Company, in the position the employee left, or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the employee is qualified to perform. If the returning employee cannot qualify for the position he/she would have attained absent military service, he/she will be reemployed if qualified in any other position that is the nearest approximation to that position. Stack Fitness will make reasonable efforts, such as training or retraining, to enable returning employees to refresh and upgrade their skills in order to qualify for reemployment in the position they would have held if employment had been uninterrupted by military service. Stack Fitness will reasonably accommodate any disability of a returning employee to the extent required by law. Employees reemployed after an absence for covered service of more than 30 days have protection from discharge without just cause for either 180 days for absences between 31-180 days, and one year for absences greater than 180 days. H.  Exception to Reemployment: In addition to the employee's failure to apply for reemployment in a timely manner, an employee is not entitled to reinstatement as described above if any of the following conditions exist: The Company's circumstances have so changed as to make reemployment impossible or unreasonable. The employee's employment prior to the military service was merely for a brief, non-recurrent period and there was no reasonable expectation that the employment would have continued indefinitely or for a significant period. The employee did not receive an honorable discharge from military service. I. General Benefits Upon Reemployment: Employees reemployed following military leave will receive seniority and other benefits determined by seniority that the employee had at the beginning of the military leave, plus any additional seniority and benefits the employee would have attained, with reasonable certainty, had the individual remained continuously employed. In addition, an employee's time spent on active military duty will be counted toward their eligibility for FMLA leave once they return to their job at Stack Fitness. Employees will provide the Company military discharge documentation that establishes the timeliness of the applications for reemployment and length and character of the employee's military service.",

        "Title": "FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA)",
        "Detail": "Requests for leaves of absence should be made to the Benefits Manager or Human Resources Department in writing in accordance with the following guidelines. All forms and documentation must be submitted to the Benefits Manager. A request form may be obtained from the Benefits Manager and submitted at least 30 days prior to commencement of any leave. The form must be complete with an expected return date and the reason for the leave of absence must be clearly stated. In the case of emergency leaves, the employee will be expected to submit and sign the request form as soon as practical. The Benefits Manager will promptly inform the employee in writing as to the disposition of the request by a copy of the completed request form. Approved leaves will indicate the beginning and the ending date of the leave. Leaves of absence for medical reasons may not generally exceed 12 weeks during any 12-month period or up to 26 weeks for National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  This maximum limit on the amounts of leaves of absence will be enforced in conformity with the applicable laws of the different states and locations in which Stack Fitness operates and will be extended or modified when required by law. An employee will be expected to use and exhaust his or her accrued but unused PTO time during an otherwise unpaid leave of absence. The use of these benefits runs concurrently with the period of FMLA leave, and does not extend the 12-week period or 26 weeks for NDAA. During a leave of absence an employee may be required to report his or her status periodically, as requested by management.  (Employees may be required to provide appropriate certification of the need for family leave, such as a birth certificate or adoption records.) Employees may maintain insurance coverage during an approved leave of absence and must continue to pay their portion of any insurance premiums during the leave. Payments must be received by Stack Fitness by the first day of each month, and it is the employee's responsibility to make arrangements to ensure timely and proper payments. Failure to make timely payments may result in the cancellation of insurance coverage if premiums are more than 30 days late. If coverage is canceled, the employee will be given notice of insurance continuation rights under COBRA. The time during which an employee is not working while on an approved leave of absence is not used to accrue eligibility for PTO benefits, except where otherwise required by law. Failure to return to work upon the expiration of a leave of absence will result in administrative termination from the payroll except where an extension of the leave has been requested and granted in writing in advance of the specified return date. Employees must request extensions in writing and obtain approval prior to the expected date of their return to work. Medical leaves will not generally be extended beyond the maximum 12-week allotment. The following actions while on leave are grounds for immediate termination: Accepting other employment during a leave of absence The falsification of the reason(s) for a leave of absence request",

Employees are eligible for 12 weeks of leave during a rolling 12-month period. The eligibility period is based on the 12-month period prior to the date of the commencement of a requested leave. Upon return to work from an approved FMLA leave, an employee will be reinstated to the same or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay and benefits. Employees requesting an FMLA leave must provide a completed Certification of Health Care Provider. Forms for the Certification of a Health Care Provider may be requested from the Benefits Manager. FMLA-qualifying leaves due to a serious health condition of an eligible employee or family member may be taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis. There must generally be a medical need that can best be addressed by intermittent or reduced schedule leave, and the need must be certified in writing by a health care practitioner. Eligible employees must make all reasonable efforts to schedule the intermittent or reduced schedule leave so as not to disrupt Stack Fitness’s operations, and Stack Fitness may temporarily transfer employees to alternate jobs during periods of recurring leaves in order to minimize disruptions and better accommodate the business needs. During such leave, an employee's wages may be reduced based on time actually worked. An employee returning from FMLA leave must provide to the Benefits Manager a physician's statement releasing the employee to return to work and providing information sufficient to permit Stack Fitness to determine whether the employee can safely perform the essential functions of his or her job.  Employees may be required to provide appropriate certification of the need for family leave, such as a birth certificate or adoption records. Stack Fitness complies with all state and local laws governing job protected leaves of absence.

        "Title": "PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE",
        "Detail": "Stack Fitness recognizes that employees may require time off in addition to PTO for personal and other reasons not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act or other leaves. This policy explains when and how employees may request unpaid Personal Leave. A Personal Leave may be granted when you need additional leave not available under other Company policies as a reasonable accommodation for a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar state laws. The eligibility criteria and length of maximum leave set forth in this policy are subject to applicable law and do not necessarily apply to individuals with disabilities who may need Personal Leave as an accommodation. The following procedures are required when requesting Personal Leave: You must submit a request in writing to your supervisor You also must report your requested Personal Leave to the Company’s Human Resources Department You must submit your request at least 14 calendar days in advance of the requested leave date unless it is impracticable for you to do so. Failure to timely submit a written request may result in denial of your request or delay in approval The Company reserves the right to request additional information/documentation if necessary to approve a request for Personal Leave and to delay a determination until sufficient information is received Unpaid leaves may be requested by full time employees who have completed their 90-day introductory period. Employees are limited to one (1) unpaid personal leave of up to 30-days during any rolling 12-month period which will run concurrently with all other applicable leaves of absence. Personal leave may not be requested intermittently and must be taken as a single block of leave. If a granted leave request is less than 30-days, the balance of the 30-days is lost and the employee may not request another personal leave during the current 12-month period. In extreme circumstances, the Company will consider a request to extend a personal leave up to a total of 60-days, but such a request must be made in writing and before the end of the initial 30-day leave. Requests for Personal Leave are considered and evaluated on an individual basis and granted at the Company’s discretion. In deciding on a Personal Leave request, the Company may consider, in addition to your personal situation and the necessity for leave: your job performance, attendance, the current level of business activity, the need for properly trained personnel, and/or the availability of replacements. Occasionally this will mean that different conclusions are reached on similar requests for Personal Leave. All vacation and other paid time off must be used prior to a request for Personal Leave being granted. Requesting Personal Leave to work for another company or for a personal business is not an acceptable reason for requesting leave. Any employee found doing so while on leave or who otherwise fraudulently requests or obtains Personal leave, is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Personal Leave will not be granted for recreational reasons. (i.e., vacationing, fishing, participating in sporting events, etc.) Employee benefits will be continued in the same manner as received prior to the leave for the entire length of the approved unpaid leave, but the employee will be required to remit payment for the employee's portion of the health insurance premium prior to departing for unpaid personal leave, and in an amount equivalent to the expected period of absence. The Company will attempt to return an employee to his or her former position or a comparable position upon return from personal leave, at our discretion. Given changing business needs, however, no guarantee of reinstatement can be made. Employees on leave are asked to confirm their return date at least two weeks before they return to work. Employees on leave who do not return as scheduled, and fail to request an extension or cannot show good reason why an extension should be granted, will be considered to have voluntarily terminated their employment as of the day the original leave expired.",

Note: For our applicable hourly employees, their annual salary will be calculated using their base hourly rate of pay multiplied by 2,080 working calendar hours annually. Birth of the employee's child; Placement of a child with the employee for adoption; and Placement of a child with the employee for foster care If both spouses work for Company and are eligible for paid parental leave under this policy, the spouses will be limited to a combined total of 6 workweeks off for the birth, adoption or placement of the same child. In no case will an employee receive more than 10 weeks of paid parental leave in any 12-month period, regardless of whether more than one qualifying event occurs during that 12-month period. Upon exhaustion of paid parental leave, any short-term disability leave, and any accrued PTO available, will be processed.",

        "Title": "MODIFIED DUTY",
        "Detail": "Stack Fitness will make an effort to provide modified or restructured work assignments on a temporary basis as necessary to allow employees who experience a job-related illness or injury to return to work earlier than might otherwise be allowed. This policy applies only to existing work or assignments supported by a legitimate business need. Job positions will not be restructured for non-work related injuries or illnesses except as necessary to reasonably accommodate qualified persons with a disability in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Specific medical limitations must be identified before assigning a person to a special assignment. These limitations must be documented in writing by a physician and submitted to the Benefits Manager. Eligibility for modified duty assignments is generally limited to individuals whose medical condition is likely to improve and who are likely to return to work in their original position by the end of the assignment. An employee offered a special assignment that is consistent with the employee's medical restrictions must accept such assignment to maintain his or her employment status, except to the extent the employee is entitled to leave under FMLA. Failure to accept an appropriate modified duty assignment may affect an employee's eligibility for workers' compensation benefits. Special assignments are provided for defined periods, not to exceed 60 calendar days. An employee on special assignment is expected to meet all job requirements of the assignment and is subject to all company rules, policies and procedures. While on special assignment an employee shall be paid the rate of pay for his or her regularly assigned position unless indefinitely transferred to another existing job which he or she is able to perform, in which case the employee's pay will be adjusted accordingly. Normally, an employee will not be assigned to special assignments in his or her regular assigned job. If it is necessary to assign the employee to perform work duties contained in his or her regular assigned job that have been modified to accommodate the medical condition, substitute functions should be added to replace those regular job functions that were removed. At the completion of the special assignment, the employee should either be: Returned to his or her regular job or a comparable assignment, if medical approval has been obtained; Placed on a leave of absence, if otherwise eligible; Offered a transfer to an open position for which he or she is qualified and is able to perform. The employee shall be paid at that position's prevailing rate of pay; or If no regular positions are available and the employee is not otherwise eligible for a leave of absence, administratively terminate the employee with the understanding that he or she is eligible for rehire.",

        "Title": "Work Schedule",
        "Detail": "Beginning Tuesday, July 6th, 2021, all employees whose established work location, prior to the pandemic, was our Corporate HQ in Boca Raton, will be required to work out of our Corporate HQ on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday each week. On Monday and Friday, employees may elect to work from home if they would like to do so. To provide further flexibility in work schedules, we are also adjusting our standard work hours to accommodate Flex Time. For the purposes of this policy, Flex Time is defined as “a system of working a set number of hours with the starting and finishing times chosen within agreed limits”. Stack Fitness’s flextime policy will still require employees to work a full 8-hour day, but that 8-hour day may begin and end between the hours of 7:30am and 6pm. Employees, who leverage this Flex Time benefit, are expected to effectively communicate their schedules to their supervisor and ensure their scheduled hours are approved and align with the needs of the business. Requesting Permission to Work Remotely Full Time Employees who would like to explore the option of working remotely on a full-time basis must first request approval from their supervisor and Human Resources. Stack Fitness has created a “Remote Work Criteria Checklist” for managers to identify roles that are conducive to working remotely. Employees in roles which meet the requirements of this checklist may be allowed to work remotely full-time. If the requirements of an employee’s role do not meet the Remote Work Criteria Checklist requirements they will not be permitted to work from home. Employees who are hired as remote workers or later approved to work remotely full-time must abide by this Policy and will be expected to perform the essential functions of their job and communicate with your supervisor and coworkers at a level consistent with employees working at the office. NOTE: If a company-wide remote workplace is implemented, all Employees will be expected not to report to our Corporate Headquarters for work but instead to work remotely until instructed to return to Headquarters.",

Employees should make efforts to avoid using other employees' phones, desks, offices or other work tools and equipment, when possible. If necessary, clean and disinfect them before and after use. Stack Fitness will take steps to clean and disinfect all facility areas that have been used or may have been used by a person with a confirmed positive test result for the disease or who exhibited disease symptoms while at work. Travel restrictions. Stack Fitness will evaluate the risk of employee exposure to the infectious disease from business travel, and may restrict, cancel or ban business travel as necessary to minimize or prevent risk of infection. In making such determinations, consideration will be given to any travel bans or advisories issued by government agencies, including the US Department of State and the CDC. Nonessential activities. During an infectious disease outbreak or pandemic Stack Fitness may postpone or cancel all nonessential activities, including meetings, gatherings and training sessions. Affected employees would be notified as soon as practicable. Vaccination. Stack Fitness will attempt to make a vaccine for the infectious disease accessible at the workplace once a vaccine is publicly available. Employees are encouraged to contact their doctor or healthcare provider to get vaccinated.",

Any employee, paid or unpaid intern or non-employee who is aware of such behavior against others, should immediately provide a written or verbal report to his or her supervisor, any other member of management, Human Resources, or the Company’s Anonymous Harassment Reporting Hotline whose contact information is found at the end of this policy. Employees are not required to make a complaint directly to their immediate supervisor. Although, any supervisors or managers who do receive complaints of misconduct are required to immediately report such complaints to a member of the Human Resources Team. In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct themselves, supervisors and managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual abuse and molestation or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual abuse and molestation to continue. When a report is received, the Company will immediately notify the appropriate local law enforcement agency and, if allowed by law enforcement, conduct its own internal investigation which will be fair, timely, thorough and objective with the intent to provides all parties appropriate due process and reach reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected. The Company expects all employees to fully cooperate with any investigation conducted by the Company or law enforcement into a complaint of proscribed abuse. The Company will maintain confidentiality surrounding the investigation to the extent possible and to the extent permitted under applicable federal and state law. Upon completion of the investigation, and if approved by law enforcement, the Company will communicate its conclusion as soon as practical. If the Company determines that this policy has been violated, remedial action will be taken, commensurate with the severity of the offense, up to and including termination of employment. Appropriate action will also be taken to deter any such conduct in the future. Please note that Stack Fitness’s Sexual Abuse and Molestation Prevention Policy may be construed to be more protective of all children, youth, members, guests, vendors, customers and volunteers than the law requires. Regardless, Stack Fitness may discipline any individual who violates this policy even if such conduct does not rise to the level of a violation of the law.

The arbitrator shall render an award and a written opinion to both parties in the form typically rendered in labor arbitrations. The opinion should be issued within 30 days from the later of the date on which the arbitration hearing concludes or the date on which post-hearing briefs (if applicable) are received.

Likewise, Employee acknowledges that, his/her continued employment with the Company after receiving notice of this Program (and any amendments to the Program) will also constitute consideration for the agreement to arbitrate (and any modifications to the agreement to arbitrate) and such continued employment will demonstrate acceptance of the provisions of this Program. b)Not an Employment Agreement The agreement to arbitrate (as set forth in the Program and the Agreement) is not, and shall not be construed to create, any contract of employment, express or implied, nor shall this Program or the Agreement be construed in any way to change the status of the Employee from at-will status. c)Term, Modification and Revocation The parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall survive the employer-employee relationship between the Company and the Employee and shall apply to any covered claim whether it arises or is asserted during or after termination of the Employee’s employment with the Company or the expiration of any benefit plan.  No employee of Company can orally amend, modify or change the terms of this Program. This Program can be modified or revoked in writing only by the Company’s corporate general counsel, CEO or President of the company. Such modification or revocation will only take place with 14 days’ notice to the Employees. Further, any modification or revocation will not apply to any claim that has already been submitted under this Program. d)Severability If any provision of this Program or the Agreement is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the Program or Agreement. e)Sole and Entire Agreement This Program document and the Agreement to Arbitrate constitute the complete agreement of the parties on the subject of arbitration of disputes, except for any arbitration provision contained in any pension plan, benefit plan, or collective bargaining agreement. This Program document and the Agreement supersede any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreement or understanding on the subject. f)Effective Date This Amended and Restated Dispute Resolution Program is effective as of May 1, 2016",

For this reason, the Company's national handbook (\"National Handbook\") includes this Washington Supplement (\"Washington Supplement\"), together, the \"Employee Handbook\". The Washington Supplement, however, applies only to Washington employees. It is intended as a resource containing specific provisions derived under Washington law that apply to the employee's employment. It should be read together with the National Handbook and, to the extent that the policies in the Washington Supplement are different from or more generous than those in the National Handbook, the policies in the Washington Supplement will apply. The Washington Supplement is not intended to create a contract of continued employment or alter the at-will employment relationship. Only the CEO, President or their authorized representative has the authority to enter into an agreement that alters the at-will employment relationship, and any such agreement must be in writing and signed by the CEO, President or their authorized representative. If employees have any questions about these policies, they should contact a member of the Human Resources Team.",

Under this policy, reasonable accommodations include: providing more frequent, longer or flexible restroom breaks; modifying a no-food or -drink policy; job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, or reassignment to a vacant position; acquiring or modifying equipment, devices or an employee's work station; providing seating or allowing the employee to sit more frequently if her job requires her to stand; providing for a temporary transfer to a less-strenuous or less-hazardous position; providing assistance with manual labor and limits on lifting; scheduling flexibility for prenatal visits; and any further pregnancy accommodation an employee may request, to which the Company will give reasonable consideration in consultation with information provided on pregnancy accommodation by the Department of Labor and Industries or the employee's attending health care provider, as applicable. Reasonable accommodations also include reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk for up to two years after the child's birth. The Company will provide a private location, other than a bathroom, and reasonable break time each time the employee has a need to express milk. Unless the Company does so or would do so for other classes of employees who need accommodation, accommodation under this policy does not include creating additional employment that the Company would not otherwise have created, terminating any employee, transferring any employee with more seniority or promoting any employee who is not qualified to perform the job. The Company may request that an employee seeking an accommodation under this policy provide written certification from her treating health care professional regarding the need for accommodation, except that the Company will not request written certification for the following accommodations: (1) providing more frequent, longer or flexible restroom breaks; (2) modifying a no-food or -drink policy; (3) providing seating or allowing the employee to sit more frequently if her job requires her to stand; (4) limits on lifting over 17 pounds; or (5) reasonable break time and a private location to express breast milk. The Company will not discriminate or retaliate against employees who request, decline or use an accommodation under this policy. In addition, the Company will not require an employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided for the employee's pregnancy.",

        "Title": "MEAL AND REST BREAKS",
        "Detail": "Nonexempt employees working more than five hours in a shift will be allowed a meal break of at least 30 minutes. The meal break must be taken between the second and the fifth hour of work. An additional meal break will be provided for each additional five hours of work and will be given within five hours from the end of the first meal break. Nonexempt employees who work three or more hours longer than the normally scheduled shift will be allowed at least one 30-minute meal break prior to or during that extra work time. Meal breaks of at least 30 minutes, during which the employee is completely relieved from duty, are unpaid. Meal breaks may be voluntarily waived by an employee. Any such waiver may be revoked by the employee at any time. Any employee who is required to work through some or all of a 30-minute meal break or whose 30-minute meal break is interrupted should report it to Human Resources. Nonexempt employees must take a 10-minute paid rest break for every four hours worked and must not work more than three consecutive hours without a paid 10-minute rest break. An employee's paid rest breaks do not have to be scheduled in 10-minute blocks if the nature of the work allows the employee to take shorter, intermittent rest breaks totaling 10 minutes for every four hours worked. A rest break taken in a 10-minute block must be scheduled as near as possible to the midpoint of the work period. An employee may not waive a paid rest break. Any employee who does not receive a rest break in accordance with this policy should report it. If an employee does not report a missed or shortened meal or rest break, the Company will assume the employee took his or her meal and rest breaks as required by this policy. All nonexempt employees must record their meal breaks. Employees are expected to take their meal and rest breaks and management is expected to ensure that employees take meal and rest breaks in accordance with this policy. Supervisors may not pressure or coerce employees to work through their meal or rest breaks. Any employee who feels he or she has been pressured or coerced into working through a meal or rest break should immediately report the situation to Human Resources.

Eligible employees will be allowed up to 15 days of leave per deployment, to be taken after the employee's spouse has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty and before deployment or when the spouse is on leave from deployment.

        "Title": "MILITARY LEAVE",
        "Detail": "Uniformed Services In addition to the military leave rights set forth in the National Handbook, regular full- and part-time (i.e., non-temporary) Washington employees who are members of the uniformed services, including the United States armed forces, reserves, National Guard, commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, Coast Guard and any other category designated by the President in time of war or emergency, may take a military leave of absence for any of the following types of service: Active duty; Active and inactive duty for training; Initial active duty for training; Full-time National Guard duty; and Examination to determine fitness to perform any of these duties. Employees must notify their supervisor of membership in the uniformed services within a reasonable time upon accepting employment or becoming a member of the uniformed services. Time off under this policy is without pay. Employees will be considered as having been on furlough or a leave of absence during the leave and will be entitled to participate in insurance or other benefits offered by the Company in accordance with the established rules and practices regarding employee leaves of absence in effect at the time the employee is ordered to service. The Company will reemploy employees returning from military leave unless reemployment is impossible or unreasonable because of changed circumstances, reemployment presents an undue hardship for the Company or the position the individual held before leaving to serve was temporary. Unless one of these exceptions applies, the Company will reinstate employees, provided that the: Leave does not exceed four years, unless a period of additional service is imposed by law; Employee provides proper notice of the intent to return to employment with the Company; and Employee provides a receipt of an honorable discharge, report of separation, certificate of satisfactory service or other proof of having satisfactorily completed service. Employees must notify the Company of their intent to return to employment following military service in accordance with the following timing requirements: For individuals whose period of service was fewer than 31 days, not later than the beginning of the first full regularly scheduled work period on the first calendar day following the completion of the period of service, safe transport to the individual's residence and an additional eight-hour period; For individuals whose period of service was more than 30 but fewer than 181 days, not later than 14 days after completion of the period of service; For individuals whose period of service was for more than 180 days, not later than 90 days after the completion of the period of service; and For individuals hospitalized for or convalescing from an illness or injury incurred in or aggravated during the period of military service, up to two years from the date of injury. The Company may require documentation demonstrating that the employee has met advance notice requirements, has not exceeded the four-year leave limitation and has not been dishonorably discharged. However, the Company will not deny reemployment to an employee who fails to meet a documentation requirement if the failure occurs because such documentation does not exist or is not readily available at the time of the request. However, if documentation becomes available subsequent to reemployment that establishes that the requirements outlined above were not met, the Company may terminate employment and any benefits provided. Unless the Company's circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable to do so, employees returning from service will be reinstated to their prior position or a position of like seniority, status and pay, as long as they are still qualified to perform the duties of that position. If an employee is unable to perform the duties of his or her prior position due to a disability sustained during military service, but is qualified to perform the duties of another position, the Company will reinstate the employee to the other position with like seniority, status and pay (or the closest approximation) consistent with the employee's circumstances. An employee who is returning from military leave with the United States armed forces will not be terminated without cause for one year following the date of reemployment. State Organized Militia Employees who are members of the state organized militia will be allowed a leave of absence of up to 12 weeks per calendar year when called to state-ordered active duty. When the Governor has declared a state of emergency necessitating a longer period of service, employees will be allowed up to 12 months of leave. All employees who are members of the state organized militia and are called to active state service or inactive duty will be allowed to apply for job restoration, though reinstatement is only required for those whose military absence was under three months.",

        "Title": "FAMILY CARE LEAVE",
        "Detail": "In accordance with Washington's Family Care Act (WFCA), employees may use their choice of earned sick leave or other earned paid time off to care for a child of the employee with a health condition that requires treatment or supervision or to care for a spouse, state-registered domestic partner, parent, parent-in-law or grandparent of the employee who has a serious health condition or an emergency condition. When using paid time off for these purposes, the employee must comply with those terms of the applicable leave policy that do not conflict with the WFCA. For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply: \"Child\" - a biological, adopted or foster child; a stepchild; a legal ward; or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who is: (1) under 18 years of age; or (2) 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability; \"Parent\" - a biological parent of an employee or an individual who stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child; A \"health condition that requires treatment or supervision\" (for which an employee may use paid leave to care for his or her child) - any medical condition requiring treatment or medication that the child cannot self-administer, any medical or mental health condition that would endanger the child's safety or recovery without the presence of a parent or guardian, and any condition warranting treatment or preventive health care that a parent must be present to authorize and when sick leave may otherwise be used for the employee's preventive health care. A \"serious health condition\" (for which an employee may use paid leave to care for an adult family member) - an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves: (1) any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, and any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment or recovery in connection with such inpatient care; or (2) continuing treatment by or under the supervision of a health care provider or a provider of health care services and that includes any period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend school or perform other regular daily activities). An \"emergency condition\" (for which an employee may use paid leave to care for an adult family member) - a health condition that is a sudden, generally unexpected occurrence or set of circumstances related to one's health, which demands immediate action and is typically very short term in nature. The Company may require certification or verification from a health care provider. The Company will not terminate, demote, discipline or otherwise retaliate or discriminate against an employee for requesting or taking time off in accordance with this policy.",

        "Title": "DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT OR STALKING LEAVE",
        "Detail": "Employees who are the victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, or whose family member is the victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, may take reasonable leave from work to: Seek legal or law enforcement assistance or remedies to ensure the health and safety of the employee or the employee's family members; Seek treatment by a health care provider for physical or mental injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; Attend to health care treatment for a victim who is the employee's family member; Obtain, or assist a family member in obtaining, services from a domestic violence shelter, rape crisis center or other social services program for relief from domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; Obtain, or assist a family member in obtaining, mental health counseling related to an incident of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking in which the employee or the employee's family member was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; or Participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocate or take other actions to increase the employee's safety or the safety of the employee's family members from future domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking. For purposes of this policy, a \"family member\" includes a child (including a biological, adopted, foster, or stepchild, legal ward or child for whom the employee stands in loco parentis, or in the place of a parent), spouse (including state-registered domestic partners and same-sex spouses), parent, parent-in-law, grandparent or person with whom the employee has a dating relationship. When possible, employees must give the Company notice of their intention to take leave for these purposes at least 2-days in advance. When advance notice is not possible because of an emergency or unforeseen circumstances due to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, an employee or someone on the employee's behalf must give notice no later than the end of the first day the employee takes leave. The Company may require verification that the employee or family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking and that the leave is being taken for one of the purposes described above. Verification may be provided by written statement confirming these facts or by other appropriate documentation, such as a police report or court order, and must be provided in a timely manner. Employees will not be required to provide additional information beyond this required verification, or information that would compromise the safety of the employee or his or her family member. Except as otherwise required or permitted by law, the Company will maintain the confidentiality of all information employees provide regarding this leave, including the fact that the employee or a family member is a victim or that the employee has requested leave for these purposes. When taking leave under this policy, an employee may choose to use any available paid leave, including PTO. Otherwise, leave will be unpaid. Leave may be taken intermittently, on a reduced work schedule or in a single block of time, as the circumstances warrant. During the leave, the Company will maintain any health insurance coverage being provided in the same manner as if the employee had not taken leave. The leave must be reasonable in duration, which will be determined by management and the affected employee, based upon the circumstances. Upon return from leave under this policy, an employee will be reinstated to the position held prior to taking leave or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment, subject to certain exceptions as provided under Washington law. The Company will not terminate, threaten to terminate, suspend or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee because the employee requests or takes leave in accordance with this policy, files or expresses an intent to file a complaint alleging a violation of Washington's law on leave for domestic violence victims, or participates or assists in another employee's attempt to exercise rights under that law. Employees may also be entitled to a reasonable accommodation under the Company's Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault or Stalking policy and should consult that policy and/or contact a member of the Benefits or Human Resources Team for additional information.",

        "Title": "PAID SICK AND SAFE LEAVE (SEATTLE)",
        "Detail": "The Company provides eligible employees who perform work in Seattle with paid sick and safe leave (Sick Time and Safe Time, collectively Sick and Safe Time) in accordance with the requirements of Seattle's Paid Sick and Safe Time Ordinance (SPSSTO). The company also complies with Washington's Paid Sick and Safe Leave Law (PSSLL) and will comply with all applicable requirements of the PSSLL that are more favorable to employees. Eligibility Full-time employees receive PTO (paid time off) which is a combination of traditional vacation, sick and safe leave plans (see the Paid Time Off policy in the National Handbook for details on that policy). Employees who accrue PTO may use accrued and unused PTO for any absence covered within this policy or under PSSLL or SPSSTO. Full-time employees therefore do not accrue Sick and Safe Time under this policy. All part-time employees who perform work within the geographic boundaries of Seattle are eligible for Paid Sick and Safe Leave under this policy. Paid interns who work in Seattle are also eligible, as are temporary employees other than those supplied by a staffing agency or similar entity. Employees who are typically based outside of Seattle but who work in Seattle on an occasional basis (Occasional Employees) are eligible for Sick and Safe Time once they have worked more than 240 hours in Seattle within a calendar year. If an Occasional Employee works more than 240 hours in a calendar year, he or she will remain eligible to accrue Sick and Safe Time for the duration of his or her employment with the Company. In addition, all previous hours worked in Seattle during the calendar year will count toward the accrual of paid sick and safe time. Part-Time Employees who are based outside of Seattle but travel to and perform work in Seattle are required to track the time spent working within Seattle city limits in UKG Pro Time Management. Reasons Sick and Safe Time May Be Used Employees may use accrued Sick Time for any of the following reasons: The employee's mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; to allow an employee to obtain a medical diagnosis, care or treatment for the same; or for an employee's need for preventive medical care; or To allow an employee to care for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; who needs to obtain a medical diagnosis, care or treatment for the same; or who needs preventive medical care. Employees may use accrued Safe Time for any of the following reasons: The employee's place of business has been closed by order of a public official, for any health-related reason, to limit exposure to an infectious agent, biological toxin or hazardous material; The employee's place of business has reduced operations or closed for any health- or safety-related reason; When the employee's family member's school or place of care has been closed; The employee or the employee's family or household member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking and needs time off to: Seek legal or law enforcement assistance, Obtain treatment by a health care provider, social services or mental health counseling; Participate in safety planning; Relocate; or Take other actions to increase the safety of the employee or the employee's family member. For purposes of this policy, \"family member\" means a child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild or sibling. \"Parent\" means a biological parent, adoptive parent, de facto parent, foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of an employee or the employee's spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child. \"Child\" means a biological child, adopted child, foster child, step child, or a child to whom an employee stands in loco parentis, is a legal guardian or is a de facto parent, regardless of age or dependency status. For use of Safe Time related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, \"family or household member\" includes children, spouses, domestic partners, parents, parents-in-law, stepparents, stepchildren, grandparents, grandchildren; former spouses, former domestic partners, persons who have a child in common (regardless of whether they have been married or lived together) any adult person related to the employee by blood or marriage and any person with whom the employee has a current or former dating or cohabitation relationship. A \"parent\" includes a biological or adoptive parent, or an individual who stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child. A \"child\" for purposes of Safe Time related to domestic violence means a biological, adopted, foster or step child, a legal ward or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who is under 18 years of age or is 18 or older but is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability. For purposes of Safe Time for health-related closures, a \"child\" means a biological child, adopted child, foster child, stepchild or a child to whom an employee stands in loco parentis, is a legal guardian or is a de facto parent, regardless of age or dependency status. Accrual and Use of Sick and Safe Time Stack Fitness is considered a Tier 3 employer for purposes of the SPSSTO. Accordingly, eligible employees accrue paid Sick and Safe Time at the rate of one hour per 30 hours worked. There is no cap on accrual of Sick and Safe Time under this policy. Occasional Employees only accrue Sick and Safe Time under this policy for the hours that are worked in Seattle. Nonexempt employees will accrue Sick and Safe Time on eligible hours worked, including overtime hours. Nonexempt employees will not accrue paid sick and safe time while using paid sick and safe leave, vacation or other paid time off. Exempt employees' accrual of Sick and Safe Time will be based on a 40-hour workweek or each employee's normal workweek, whichever is less. Eligible employees will begin accruing Sick and Safe Time upon the commencement of employment with the Company. The Company will provide employees with a written statement of available Sick and Safe Time, as well as Sick and Safe Time accruals and reductions, each time wages are paid. Employees may begin using accrued Sick and Safe Time on the 90th calendar day after commencement of employment with the Company, or, for Occasional Employees, after working 240 hours in Seattle within a calendar year. Occasional Employees may only use paid Sick and Safe Time that is accrued exclusively under the Seattle paid sick leave law (SPSSTO) and is in excess of leave amounts provided in accordance with the Washington state law during times when they are scheduled to perform work in Seattle. Exempt employees can only use paid Sick and Safe Time under this policy when scheduled to perform work in Seattle. The Company will allow employees to use their Sick and Safe Time in increments of 30 minutes. Exempt employees who are absent for less than one hour will not be charged Sick and Safe Time. Failure to use Sick and Safe Time in good faith and for the reasons specified in this policy can result in discipline, including withholding of payment for time taken for an unauthorized purpose. Requesting Sick and Safe Time/Documentation Employees must provide the Company with a written request for Sick and Safe Time at least 10 days in advance, unless the need for leave is unforeseeable. The request can be written and transmitted electronically, including by email.  If the need for leave is foreseeable, employees must schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the Company's operations. When possible, the request should include the anticipated start of the leave and the anticipated duration of the absence. If the need for leave is unforeseeable, employees must provide notice as soon as possible before they are scheduled to begin work. Employees are not required to find an employee to cover their work when they take paid Sick and Safe Time. The Company will not count employees' use of Sick and Safe Time in compliance with this policy as an absence when evaluating absenteeism. Therefore, any such use of Sick and Safe Time will not count as an \"occurrence\" under any company policy. When employees use four or more consecutive workdays of Sick Time, the Company may require a doctor's note or other verification of the need for the absence. Any required documentation for purposes of Sick Time must be provided within 10 calendar days following the first day the employee uses Sick Time. When employees use four or more consecutive workdays of Safe Time, the Company may require verification of the closure order or verification that the employee or the employee's family or household member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking and that the Safe Time is for one of the purposes covered by the law. The Company does not intend for any of these verification requirements to place an unreasonable burden or expense on the employee. If an employee anticipates that providing required documentation will create an unreasonable burden, the employee can provide an explanation of: why the absence was a permissible use of paid sick and safe leave; and how the required verification creates an unreasonable burden or expense for the employee. Compensation Pay for Sick and Safe Time will be calculated based on an employee's normal hourly compensation at the time of the absence or the effective minimum wage, whichever is greater. Employees will receive Sick and Safe Time pay for the hours they were scheduled to work during the absence, including regular hours, overtime hours, hours an on-call employee is required to work after being contacted by the Company and Company-required training hours. For non-exempt employees, pay for Sick and Safe Time does not include the overtime premium for hours that, if worked, would have been in excess of 40 per week. The Company does not pay employees for accrued, unused Sick and Safe Time at any time, including upon termination of employment. Leave Carryover Accrued Sick and Safe Time may be carried over from year to year, up to a maximum carryover amount of 72 hours. Sick and Safe Time accrued in the subsequent year will be in addition to the Sick and Safe Time carried over. If, at the end of the year, an employee has accrued more than 72 hours of Sick and Safe Time, the employee may carry over only 72 hours to the next year, and the remaining accrued Sick and Safe Time will be forfeited.",

Qualifying Reasons for and Length of Leave During a benefit year, eligible employees may be entitled to: Up to a maximum of 12 weeks of paid family leave to: (1) participate in providing care (including physical or psychological care) for a \"family member\" of the employee made necessary by the family member's serious health condition; (2) bond with the employee's child under the age of 18 during the first 12 months following the child's birth, adoption or foster care placement; and (3) attend to a \"qualifying exigency,\" as defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), arising from the \"covered active duty\" (as defined below) of an employee's family member as a member of the military reserves, National Guard or Armed Forces. Up to a maximum of 12 weeks of paid medical leave to attend to their own serious health condition. Medical leave may be extended up to an additional two weeks (up to 14 weeks of medical leave), if the employee experiences a pregnancy-related serious health condition that results in incapacity. An eligible employee may receive up to a combined total of 16 weeks of medical and family leave, which may be extended to 18 weeks if the employee experiences a pregnancy-related serious health condition that results in an incapacity. An employee is not entitled to WPFMLA benefits for: (1) absences caused by the employee's willful intent to bring about injury to or sickness of the employee or another; (2) absences resulting from an injury or sickness sustained in the employee's perpetration of an illegal act; (3) any family or medical leave beginning before the employee is eligible for such benefits; (4) a period during which the employee is on suspension from employment; or (5) any period of time during which the employee works for pay or profit.",

When taking leave for reasons other than family leave for the birth or placement of the employee's child or a qualifying exigency, payment of wage replacement benefits is subject to a waiting period of seven consecutive calendar days. The waiting period begins on the Sunday of the first week an eligible employee starts taking paid family or medical leave. Employees may use available PTO or sick leave (if applicable) during the waiting period. The minimum claim duration is eight consecutive hours of leave, meaning the employee claims at least eight consecutive hours at some point during the week beginning on Sunday at 12:00 a.m. and ending at 11:59 p.m. the following Saturday. In any week in which an employee is eligible to receive benefits under federal or state unemployment compensation, industrial insurance or disability insurance laws, the employee is disqualified from receiving WPFMLA wage replacement benefits.",

        "Detail": "WPFMLA benefits may be funded by both a Company contribution and an employee contribution. Requesting Leave Employees must file an application for WPFMLA benefits directly with the Department using the Department's forms. Employees must also provide advance notice to the Company as follows: When the need for leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement of a child or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition, the employee must provide written notice to the Company at least 30 days in advance. When 30 days' notice is not possible, such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances or a medical emergency, the employee must provide written notice to the Company as soon as practicable. When the need for leave due to a qualifying military exigency is foreseeable, the employee must provide written notice to the Company as soon as is practicable, regardless of how far in advance such leave is foreseeable. When the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must provide written notice to the Company as soon as is practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. If the employee is unable to provide notice personally, written notice may be given by another responsible party, such as the employee's spouse or domestic partner, neighbor or co-worker. \"As soon as is practicable\" means as soon as it is both possible and practical to provide notice, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances in the individual situation. Written notice should be provided to a member of the Benefits or Human Resources Team and should specify the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Written notice includes, but is not limited to, handwritten or typed notices, and all forms of written electronic communications such as text messages and email. Failure to provide timely notice may result in the Department denying WPFMLA benefits. Employees must advise the Company as soon as practicable if the dates of a scheduled PFML change or are extended, or if the dates of leave were initially unknown. Employees applying for WPFMLA benefits must provide the Department with supporting documentation or certification as required by the Department. When using PFML concurrently with FMLA leave, employees must comply with the notice and certification requirements in the Company's FMLA policy. Employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the Company's operations, subject to the approval of the employee's or family member's health care provider. Whenever an employee who is qualified for WPFMLA benefits is absent from work for family leave or medical leave for a period of more than seven consecutive days, the Company will provide the employee with a written statement of the employee's rights. The notice will be provided to the employee within five business days after the employee's seventh consecutive day of absence due to family or medical leave, or within five business days after the Company has received notice that the employee's absence is for such reasons, whichever is later.",

        "Detail": "When both the FMLA and the WPFMLA apply, the leave provided by each will count against the employee's entitlement under both laws, and leave taken under the FMLA will run concurrently with leave taken under the WPFMLA. WPFMLA leave is in addition to any leave for sickness or temporary disability because of pregnancy or childbirth, as provided under the Company's Pregnancy Disability Leave policy. When an employee takes leave for pregnancy disability under both the WPFMLA and the Pregnancy Disability Leave policy, the two leaves will run concurrently, but an employee's WPFMLA leave entitlement or eligibility does not limit the amount of leave to which the employee may be entitled under the Pregnancy Disability Leave policy. For more information, please see the Pregnancy Disability Leave policies in this Washington Supplement and National Handbook. The Company will not require employees to take paid sick leave or other forms of paid time off provided by the Company before, in place of or concurrently with WPFMLA leave. An employee may choose whether or not to take paid leave provided under a collective bargaining agreement or Company policy; however, such paid leave will be a supplemental benefit to WPFMLA leave, and an employee may not take more of such paid leave than will be required to provide the employee with a total of 100% of their pay for the absence (except that an employee may use their paid sick leave as provided for by applicable law).",

        "Detail": "Stack Fitness is committed to providing a workplace free from harassment. As such, Stack Fitness will not tolerate harassment of any of our employees or independent contractors by supervisors, co-workers, customers, vendors, agents and any other third-parties. Harassment occurs when (1) an employee is subjected to unwelcome conduct, (2) that is motivated by the employee's membership in a protected category, and (3) which either affects a term or condition of the employee's employment, and/or had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the employee's work performance, and/or created a hostile work environment. A hostile work environment is a workplace that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a working environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile or abusive. Protected categories include sex, race, religion, national origin, disability, age or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. If an employee believes that he or she or any other individual has been subjected to harassment in violation of this policy, whether by an employee or non-employee, the employee must immediately report the matter to their Supervisor. If an employee is unable for any reason to contact their supervisor or has not received a satisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting any incident of what they perceive to be harassment, please contact the next level Manager. Note: If an employee’s Supervisor or next level Manager is the person toward whom the complaint is directed, an employee should contact any higher-level Manager in their reporting chain or the Human Resources Department at our corporate office (954) 530-6903. Every report of perceived harassment will be fully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Please note that Stack Fitness’s Harassment Prevention Policy may be construed to be more protective of employees than the law requires. Regardless, Stack Fitness will discipline any individual who violates this policy even if such conduct does not rise to the level of a violation of the law. All complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. In addition, Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report unwelcome conduct to management or who cooperate in the investigations of such reports in accordance with this policy. Employees who make complaints in bad faith may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. All employees must cooperate with all investigations.

        "Detail": "Stack Fitness (“Company”) is committed to providing a safe and secure environment free of sexual abuse and molestation for all children, youth, members, guests, vendors, customers and volunteers. All such sexual abuse and molestation is prohibited. Sexual abuse and molestation includes the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by forcible compulsion, the engaging of sexual contact with a person who is below a specified age or who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity. Sexual abuse is a crime. Molestation includes making unwanted or improper sexual advances towards someone, especially to force physical and usually sexual contact on someone against their will. The Company strictly prohibits any employee from engaging in any sexual abuse and molestation against anyone, specifically a child, youth, member, guest, vendor, customer, and volunteer. The Company requires all employees to notify management immediately either directly or indirectly as outlined in our complaint procedure if they are aware of or a witness of any such type behavior. The Company will not allow any retaliation against any person who comes forward to notify Company of any such sexual abuse and molestation behavior or act. Preventing sexual abuse and molestation is everyone’s responsibility. Stack Fitness cannot prevent or remedy sexual abuse unless it knows about it. Any employee, paid or unpaid intern or non-employee who is aware of such behavior against others, should immediately provide a written or verbal report to his or her supervisor, any other member of management, Human Resources, or the Company’s Anonymous Harassment Reporting Hotline whose contact information is found at the end of this policy. Any supervisors or managers who receive complaints of misconduct are required to immediately report such complaints to a member of the Human Resources Team. In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct themselves, supervisors and managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual abuse and molestation or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual abuse and molestation to continue.

        "Title": "BACKGROUND OF THE ELMHURST GROUP",
        "Detail": "The Elmhurst Group of Companies was formed in 1974 in Pittsburgh as an investment vehicle for the Hunt family.  The Hunts are longstanding member of the Pittsburgh business community.  Captain Alfred E. Hunt co-founded the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) in Pittsburgh in the late 19th century.  Elmhurst is headed by William E. Hunt, great-grandson of Captain Hunt.  The Elmhurst Group currently has 21 local properties totaling over 2 million square feet of high-quality office, distribution and light industrial space and employs over 200 people. One of the early focuses was the conversion of The Bigelow Apartments, located in Pittsburgh, Pa., into a full-service hotel. This process took years and significant investment.  In 2005, the hotel underwent a $12 million renovation and joined the Hilton family of hotels as the Doubletree Hotel and Suites Pittsburgh City Center. Recent Elmhurst acquisitions include One North Shore Center, a five-story riverfront first-class office building containing 97,000 square feet, located immediately across from PNC Park and The Shaw Building, a nine-story 130,000 square foot building located at the intersection of the PA Turnpike and US Route 22 in Monroeville, PA. In addition to acquisitions, Elmhurst has also become a major developer in the region with such developments as the Airside Business Park on the site of the former Pittsburgh Airport.  The Park, which includes an attractive courtyard, clock tower, and fountain, consists of four buildings  two flex-use and two state-of-the-art office buildings. Another continuing development project is McClaren Woods Business Park in Findlay Township. This park will consist of five buildings utilizing a combination of office, flex, manufacturing, and warehouse space. Elmhurst has completed The RAND Building, a six-story 107,000 square foot office building with three floors of underground parking, located at Fifth Avenue and Craig Street in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh.  RAND Corporation occupies 60,000 square feet and Mellon Financial Services, Citizens Bank, TIAA-Cref, Camilles Café, and Carnegie Mellon University occupy the rest. Elmhurst also recently purchased a 120,000 square foot vacant office building in Monroeville, Pennsylvania in order to renovate and expand it by an additional 60,000 square feet for a long-term lease with Bechtel Plant Machinery, Inc. As Elmhurst moves forward, its focus is on continued development of quality industrial and office properties in Western Pennsylvania.  Everyone at Elmhurst is proud to be part of a company that has been instrumental in helping this region to grow.",

The Hotel expects team members to come to work whenever their court schedule permits. The Hotel may ask the court to excuse a team member from jury duty should the leave cause an undue hardship on the Hotel.  Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, the Hotel will continue to provide benefits for the full period of unpaid jury duty leave.",

        "Detail": "The Hotel expects all of its team members to assume responsibility for their  attendance and punctuality.  Team members time is recorded electronically. If a team member is going to be tardy or absent, they must notify their department manager no later than two hours in advance of their scheduled shift. A team member will be considered tardy if they report to their work area in uniform later than 4-minutes past their scheduled starting time. A team member is considered absent when they fail to report as scheduled or fail to complete one-half day or more of scheduled work.  Exceptions will be made for the following reasons:  death in the immediate family, medical emergency for team member or immediate family member (verification required), or authorized leave of absences.  Team members who are absent three days or more will be required to provide a physicians note to return to work.  An unreported absence of three consecutive days is considered job abandonment and will be recorded as an involuntary separation of employment. A team member is considered a no call/no show if they do not report for their shift and do not call their department manager within two hours of their start time. A point system has been developed to provide clear and advance notice of point accumulations: <table><tr><td>Each instance of tardiness  \r</td><td>1 point \r</td></tr><tr><td>Violation of call-off procedure \r</td><td>1 point \r</td></tr><tr><td>Each occurrence of absenteeism \r</td><td>2 points \r</td></tr><tr><td>No call/no show \r</td><td>  5 points \r</td></tr></table> Progressive discipline will be conducted according to the accumulation of points: <table><tr><td>6 Points \r</td><td>Verbal (must be documented) \r</td></tr><tr><td>8 Points \r</td><td>First written  \r</td></tr><tr><td>10 Points \r</td><td>Second written (possible suspension at the Hotels discretion) \r</td></tr><tr><td>12 Points \r</td><td>Involuntary separation \r</td></tr></table> Team members may reduce accumulated points by one point, down to zero, for each sixty days that pass without occurrence of any of the above-mentioned infractions.  Team members will also receive a two-point reduction each calendar year on January 1. Team members who are within their introductory period will be held to the same policy with the exception that separation of employment will occur with the accumulation of six points or one no call/no show violation. This system is in place for all non-exempt hourly team members unless otherwise covered by a collective bargaining agreement.",

Another qualifying event is when a dependent child is no longer eligible for coverage under a team members benefit plan.

        "Detail": "All full and part-time, regular employees of AIG and its businesses are eligible to participate in this program. There is no minimum service requirement for participation. Employees must be meeting the performance expectations of their current role to participate in the VTO program. Employees not performing at a quality level, determined at the sole discretion of their manager will be deemed “not eligible to participate” until performance meets the level set by their manager. The benefits of this program are not available for interns, temporary agency employees, contractors, vendors, or retirees. VTO may be used on projects and with organizations that benefit the community at large. Organizations are generally eligible if they are a charitable 501 (c)(3) organization. Employees can select a charity of their choice or volunteer with other AIG employees as a team at a qualifying, not-for-profit organization. Eligible volunteer activities include: • general organizational assistance; • administrative work; • pro bono work; • manual labor; • participation on a board or committee; • fundraising events; • mentoring, tutoring, coaching, chaperoning; • social service support; or • community building.
